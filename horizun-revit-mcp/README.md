## What's new in 2.1

Every item below is part of this release, was built with the same verified-write contract
(rehearse, token, apply, re-read) and, where a fixture exists, was measured live in Revit.
The detail of each one is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

**New tools and new ways to build**

1. **Light-gauge framing, `horizun_framing`** — studs, tracks, kings, jacks, headers, sills, cripples and blocking inside a wall layer, and suspended-ceiling framing, from a detail spec the MCP client reads from an image or DWG (prompt `framing-from-detail`).
2. **Curtain-method framing** — the same framing modeled with Curtain Walls and flat Sloped Glazing layers (stud mullions, fixed-distance grids, hangers to the floor above), for teams that work that way.
3. **Exploding multilayer walls with openings** — `horizun_split_multilayer_walls` now converts walls that host doors, windows and nested components: the carrier keeps its identity and its inserts, and every layer becomes its own wall.
4. **COBie 2.4 workbook** — `horizun_export format=cobie`: Facility, Floor, Space, Zone, Type, Component and System sheets, re-read cell by cell, with `deliverable_ready` and a finding for every missing required value.
5. **New element kinds** — sprinkler, flex pipe, flex duct, space, area and area boundary in `horizun_create_elements`; rooms and spaces for every empty circuit (`placement=all_enclosed`); toposolids (Revit 2024+).
6. **Sketch editing without losing the element** — `edit_sketch` for floors, ceilings and openings keeps the id and the hosted data.

**MEP and clash resolution**

7. **Automatic MEP routing** — `horizun_mep_routing route`: an orthogonal 3-D path around physical elements and links, with segments and elbows re-read at every junction.
8. **Gravity slopes** — `slope`: a pipe run to a target grade from a fixed end, every connection re-read.
9. **Hangers** — `hangers`: a caller family at spaced stations under the structure above (host or link).
10. **Openings and sleeves for clashes** — `horizun_resolve_clash propose_opening / apply_opening` cuts walls, floors, roofs and ceilings or places a sleeve family when a move cannot fix the clash.
11. **Clashes against links and connected runs** — moves are checked against every loaded link, and a connected pipe-elbow-pipe network moves as one rigid body (`run_shift`).
12. **System analysis** — `horizun_plan_mep system_analysis` reads the critical path, pressure loss, flow and velocity Revit computed.

**Coordination, CDE and openBIM**

13. **ACC Issues** — `horizun_cde_cloud issues_list / issue_create / issue_update`, as the signed-in user, idempotent by an external key and read back after every write.
14. **Navisworks round trip** — readiness and preparation of the 3D views Navisworks reads, and status suggestions from the coordination ledger.
15. **BCF from any tool** — Navisworks, ACC, Solibri or BIMcollab topics (BCF 2.1/3.0) resolved by IFC GUID or authoring-tool id.
16. **ISO 19650 information management** — project context (`project-intake`), information containers across WIP/Shared/Published/Archived, and IFC delivery proved against IDS, Pset mapping and georeference.
17. **Synchronize with central** — `horizun_document_session sync_with_central`, off by default and enabled only by the machine owner in Revit; relinquish all, keep borrowed or none, verified after the sync.
18. **Shared coordinates, point clouds and scan deviation** — `acquire_coordinates`, point cloud links and `scan_deviation` of model faces against a scan, with coverage measured.

**Verification you can see**

19. **Spatial check after every write** — overlaps, blocked doors, duplicates and MEP through structure are reported with the write; `horizun_verify_changes` returns an image with the changed elements highlighted.
20. **Before/after snapshots** — `snapshot / compare_to` with the same camera and a red diff mapped back to the elements written.
21. **Equipment clearance zones** — `clearance_rules` check working-space zones against host and links.
22. **Egress travel distance** — `horizun_code_check` with Revit's path of travel, reported as a lower bound or `not_decidable` with the reason.
23. **Energy readiness** — `energy_readiness` builds and rolls back the energy model and reports enclosure, constructions and window-to-wall ratio.

**Documentation, quantities and exchange**

24. **More export formats** — DWG for many views or sheets in one job, gbXML, DGN, DWFx and loaded families to `.rfa`, each file read back.
25. **Finishes by room** — `horizun_quantities room_finishes`: wall, floor and ceiling faces per room or space, by material, with openings deducted.
26. **Budget export to BC3** — `horizun_budget_compare export_bc3` (FIEBDC-3) from the takeoff and the caller's prices.
27. **Sheets and views** — `renumber_sheets` with collisions checked first, and `set_view_display` fixes detail level or discipline citing the audit finding.
28. **Structural analytical model and loads** — `horizun_query_structure analytical` and `loads`, grouped by load case.
29. **Power BI coordination dashboard** — a `.pbip` example over the coordination ledger.
30. **A smaller tool list** — `tools/list` is about 64 KB smaller without removing a tool, argument or operation, so clients load it faster.

## Watch a real workflow: PDF plans to a Revit model

[![Watch the Horizun demo: PDF plans to a Revit model with AI](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlFs5p3EM4M/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlFs5p3EM4M)

**[PDF plans → Revit model with AI — watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlFs5p3EM4M)**
is a published Spanish-language demonstration from the Horizun Hub channel.
It presents a PDF-to-Revit workflow driven by an AI client. PDF interpretation
belongs to the client/model; Horizun supplies the operations executed in Revit.
The separate typed DWG workflow below reads CAD geometry and versioned rules.

## What you can build and deliver

### Architectural, structural and MEP modeling

`horizun_create_elements` accepts dependency-aware batches of levels, grids,
walls, floors, ceilings, roofs, rooms, family instances, structural beams and
columns, beam systems, wall foundations, ducts, pipes, conduit, cable trays,
fittings, inline accessories, MEP systems, openings, shafts, room separators,
profile walls, displacement sets and supported stairs.

The suboperation table lists all 26 creation kinds and five fitting choices.
`horizun_transform_elements` handles moves, copies, rotations, wall joins,
type/curve changes and tag placement. `horizun_manage_system_types` supports
compound material-layer structures and MEP junction preferences.
Structural and MEP planners produce requests that use these same creation tools.

### New parametric families, including MEP connectors

`horizun_create_family` creates a new `.rfa` from an installed `.rft`: parameters,
formulas, named types, solid/void extrusions, blends, revolutions, sweeps and
swept blends; reference planes and labeled dimensions; supported nested families;
and pipe, duct, electrical, conduit or cable-tray connectors. Save and optional
project load are verified. `horizun_family_apply` edits existing family data with
a geometry invariant. [RFA examples and template scope](docs/FAMILY-AUTHORING.md).

### Drawings, automated annotation and sheet production

Build floor/ceiling/structural/area plans, sections, elevations, callouts, drafting
and 3D views. Manage templates, phases, crops, view ranges and scope boxes; create,
duplicate and populate sheets; place schedules and align viewports. Annotation
tools support text, tags, linear/angular/radial/diameter/arc-length dimensions
and spot elevation/coordinate/slope labels.

Plan dimensions and tags from explicit criteria, inspect geometric references,
create 2D details, audit planimetry, apply cited corrections and pack sheet zones.
`horizun_plan_views` and the `deliverable-production` prompt coordinate delivery
stages and approval state. [Drawing workflows](docs/PLANIMETRY-PRODUCTION.md).

### DWG to BIM, with traceable revision updates

Inspect DWG instances, layers and curves. Supply a versioned requirement set to
map drawing content into an ordered BIM plan. Rehearse and apply the plan through
typed tools, with source fingerprints and provenance attached to created elements.
Audit the model against the drawing; plan and apply later DWG revisions while
identifying manual model edits that need review.
These are seven dedicated CAD tools, listed individually below.
[DWG-to-BIM examples](docs/DWG-TO-BIM.md).

### Audits, coordination, quantities and data exchange

Query the host and loaded links using category, family/type, level, parameter and
spatial filters. Scan model health, audit supplied requirements and make verified
parameter corrections. Coordinate clashes with persistent findings, assignment,
decisions and model-measured resolution. Plan reinforcement, apply supported
reinforcement requests and audit their results.

Produce material takeoffs, compare them against an Excel budget baseline, read
or append XLSX rows without Excel/COM, push approved data to Power BI and export
verified deliverables. [Quantities](docs/QUANTITIES-AND-BUDGET.md),
[Power BI](docs/POWER-BI.md), [audit starter](docs/QUICK-START-BIM.md).

### Specialized model transformations and terrain

Separate wall or slab layers, split floors by loops, rectangularize supported
wall geometry, ungroup with origin tracking and regroup by a parameter. Transfer
slab elevations, embed floors in toposolids and grade terrain with breaklines and
specified slopes. Wall-layer decomposition preserves the core wall's identity
and hosted elements. Bundled recipe tools use shipped Python for geometry under
host-controlled rehearsal, transactions and their declared readback checks;
arbitrary client-generated Python has a separate permission/evidence contract.

## Install

**[Download the Windows installer](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases/latest)**

- Requires **Windows x64, Revit 2023–2027 and an MCP client**.
- Setup includes the server runtime and matching Revit add-ins.
  **No Git, Visual Studio or .NET SDK is needed.**
- Close Revit before running Setup.
- Public releases are intentionally **unsigned**. SHA-256 checks verify the
  downloaded bytes; they do not authenticate a Windows publisher. Windows and
  Revit may show a publisher warning. See the [unsigned release policy](CODE-SIGNING-POLICY.md).

1. Open the release above and download `horizun-mcp-<version>-setup.exe` and
   `SHA256SUMS.txt` from **Assets**. The source ZIP is for development.
2. Verify the hash using the [installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md), then run Setup.
3. Complete your client's connection step:

| Client | Final connection step |
|---|---|
| **Codex / Claude Code** | Let Setup's helper register after the client closes, then reopen it. |
| **Claude Desktop** | Install the `.mcpb` delivered to **Documents\Horizun-Revit-MCP** from **Settings → Extensions**, then restart Claude Desktop. |
| **ChatGPT Work** | Complete the Secure MCP Tunnel setup for the installed server. |
| **Other stdio clients** | Register the installed executable using its full path. |

4. Start Revit, open a document and ask your client to call `horizun_health`.
   Confirm the active document and loaded version.

**Claude Desktop needs the extension installation inside the app.** Setup puts
the package and illustrated instructions in the Documents folder above. Drag
the package onto the Extensions page or use **Advanced settings → Install extension**.
The extension connects to the installed server; it does not replace Setup.
See [client instructions and recovery](docs/CLIENTS.md).

### Installation video: Claude Desktop Free

[![Install Horizun Revit MCP with Claude Desktop Free](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3kp-we7MIvk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kp-we7MIvk)

**[Connect Revit to Claude Desktop Free — watch the installation tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kp-we7MIvk)**
is a Spanish-language guide published by Horizun Hub to installing and connecting
Horizun Revit MCP with the free Claude Desktop plan. Follow the Setup and `.mcpb`
steps above; the [client guide](docs/CLIENTS.md#claude-desktop) provides the written instructions.

### Optional PowerShell bootstrap

This downloads the release installer, checks its hash and runs Setup quietly.
`-AllowUnsigned` acknowledges the publisher status described above. The same
client-specific final steps still apply; use `-Interactive` for the wizard.

```powershell
$s = irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/main/install-release.ps1; & ([scriptblock]::Create($s)) -AllowUnsigned
```

The script is fetched from `main`; its checksum check applies to the downloaded
Setup. You can download and inspect the script first. See [installation options](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Complete tool catalog

Every named MCP tool is listed here, grouped by the work it performs. These groups
are a reading aid; session **tool packs** are the configurable sets implemented
in [ToolPacks.cs](src/Horizun.Revit/Core/ToolPacks.cs). Descriptions are maintained
in [the bilingual catalog](docs/readme-catalog.json); counts and membership are
checked against the server-generated [inventory](docs/inventory.json).
The [detailed tool reference](docs/TOOLS.md) documents arguments and limitations.

## Suboperations and modes

A named MCP tool can dispatch many actions. For example, creating a wall, a pipe
and a stair are choices under `horizun_create_elements`; creating a section and
placing a schedule are different actions under `horizun_manage_views`.

The table contains **457 named suboperations and dispatch modes** <!--inventory:operations-->
across 26 multi-operation tools. A choice is counted once per tool, selector
property and value, including nested selectors. Repeated `oneOf` schema paths
are deduplicated. Some selectors refine another action: these numbers describe
the exposed operation vocabulary, not 208 additional top-level tools.

Other typed options include the seven `horizun_export.format` values:
`pdf`, `dwg`, `ifc`, `nwc`, `fbx`, `image`, `schedule_csv`. The schema inventory
also records **1598 enumerated argument occurrences** <!--inventory:enumerated_variants-->
across all properties and paths; that figure includes configuration choices and
repeated paths, so it is not used as a tool count.

## Extensibility, permissions and tool discovery

**Compose new workflows:** `horizun_execute_plan` connects up to 100 typed actions
using prior results and named dependencies, with TransactionGroup rollback.
Task-specific project standards, catalogs and CAD interpretation rules are inputs.
**Extend to custom Revit API work:** an owner may enable `horizun_execute_python`
for client-generated Python, including the standard library, preflight and
structured script evidence. The Python ON/OFF grant persists until revoked.
Python results remain self-reported with `host_verified: false`.

The following profiles were measured against the same **1.3.3** server binary
in isolated settings directories using actual MCP `tools/list` calls:

| Profile and packs | Tools announced | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| `safe_write`, all packs, Python off | 70 | Default in-model work; external-effect tools are filtered |
| `full_write`, all packs, Python off | 79 | Adds file/export/document and other external-effect operations |
| `unsafe_code`, all packs, Python enabled | 80 | Complete catalog, including custom Python |
| `safe_write`, `core` only | 4 | Deliberately minimal connection and job-management set |

A session exposing fewer tools can be correctly configured for a narrow task.
Inspect `horizun_health` and the `horizun://security/current-profile` resource
before comparing a session with the complete catalog. Owners control permissions;
an evaluator does not need to enable arbitrary code just to read the catalog.

For clients that support them, the server also offers standard MCP Resources,
Prompts, Completions, logging and durable Tasks. Resources expose the compiled
tool contract, build identity, effective profile and BIM workflow guidance.
Named prompts cover family recipes, room documentation, audits and delivery.
These protocol features and workflow prompts are additional to the tool count.
`tools/list` schemas are abridged; the exact one is `horizun://contract/tools/{tool}`
(or `.../{tool}/{variant}` for one `create_elements` kind or `document_session`
operation), and a failed call that violates it names the failing path and that URI
(with `structuredContent.schema_help` when the reply is structured) ([details](docs/TOOLS-EXTENDED.md#advertised-schemas-and-the-contract)).

Tool packs, compact/summary queries, selected-field projections and durable jobs
help manage context and long-running work. Calls use a bounded 16-slot FIFO
queue; queued work can be cancelled before execution. Long operations expose a
persistent job ID and readable status. [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Tested in Revit: published release evidence

**v1.3.3**, published on **2026-09-15**, includes live release-gate reports for
the installed server and all five supported Revit years. The reports total
**1,230 passed probe executions**: 246 in each year, with zero failed, unverified
or not-covered probes in that suite. Each report identifies the release commit,
binary hashes and harness. [Release assets](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases/tag/v1.3.3).

This is one release suite executed across five Revit versions. It is maintainer
evidence for those cases, not 1,230 different features or a comparison against
another product. The [machine-readable evidence index](docs/release-evidence.json)
records the source URLs and hashes. Ongoing GitHub CI checks core/server behavior,
Windows deployment, inventory/documentation consistency and CodeQL.

Public release history starts with
[v0.5.0 on 2026-08-02](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases/tag/v0.5.0),
includes [v1.0.0 on 2026-08-26](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases/tag/v1.0.0),
and contains **16 published non-prerelease releases as of 2026-09-15**.
The GitHub stars badge above shows the current community count; the public
[release history](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases)
and [commit history](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/commits/main/)
show maintenance directly.

## Version and compatibility

| Question | Authoritative source |
|---|---|
| Latest stable download | [GitHub latest release](https://github.com/HorizunGroup/horizun-revit-mcp/releases/latest), including its publication date and assets |
| Version of this source checkout | [Directory.Build.props](Directory.Build.props) |
| Version actually loaded | `horizun_health`: version, commit, Revit year and active document |
| MCP protocol implemented | **2025-11-25**, with earlier revisions listed in [ProtocolNegotiation.cs](src/Horizun.Server/ProtocolNegotiation.cs) |
| Published registry metadata | [Official registry entry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers/io.github.HorizunGroup%2Fhorizun-revit-mcp/versions/latest) |

MCP 2026-07-28 support is pending. A recent product release does not imply support
for that protocol revision. Registry snapshots and search extracts may lag;
check the release before choosing a version. Upgrade release installations by
running the new Setup with Revit closed.
