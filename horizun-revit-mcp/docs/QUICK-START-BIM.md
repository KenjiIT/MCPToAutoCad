# BIM Quick Start

This path gets a BIM coordinator from a connected Revit model to a useful,
read-only result. It changes neither the model nor files outside it.

For release evidence, use [RELEASE-VALIDATION.md](RELEASE-VALIDATION.md). The
live Revit check belongs at the end, after code and installation work are complete.

1. Follow the [installation guide](INSTALL.md), including the
   [final client connection step](CLIENTS.md), then start Revit with the intended model open. In
   Revit, use **Horizun Hub > Estado de conexión** (Connection status); it must say that the bridge is
   active.
2. In the MCP client, call `horizun_health`. Confirm its active document is the
   exact model you intend to inspect.
3. Run the ready-made **read-only-audit** prompt, or ask:

   ```text
   Audit the active model without writes. First confirm the active document,
   then run a model scan and a pre-delivery audit. Separate measured findings,
   unknown coverage and suggested next actions.
   ```

4. If a company or project standard applies, review and provide it explicitly.
   The optional examples in [`../standards/`](../standards/) are generic
   starting points, not hidden policy.
5. Review the evidence. Only then choose a correction. Every typed correction
   must be rehearsed first and re-read after commit; keep `dry_run: true` until
   the affected elements and expected result are clear.

## Permission modes

| Mode | Intended use | What it can change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_only` | Audits, discovery and evidence | Nothing in the model or filesystem |
| `safe_write` | Verified edits inside the active model | Typed, reversible model edits only |
| `full_write` | Approved delivery outputs | Also document-session actions and external exports |
| `unsafe_code` | Owner-approved exceptional automation | Adds eligibility for Python; it is never the default |

Use the lowest mode that can accomplish the work. The mode is a machine-owner
control, not something a client or prompt may silently elevate.

## What a good request contains

Before a write, name all three: the intended outcome, the exact elements in
scope, and how the result will be recognised as correct. For example:

```text
For the active document only, rehearse a batch update of parameter `Type Mark`
to `D-101` for these explicit door element ids. Do not apply it. Report every
resolved target, any missing or read-only parameter, and the verification that
would run after commit.
```

For the complete tool reference, including every refusal, see
[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md).
