# Extended tool notes

Detail that does not belong in `tools/list` descriptions. One section per topic.

## Advertised schemas and the contract

`tools/list` advertises an **abridged copy** of each input schema; the contract
compiled into the server (and into the add-in, which shares its hash) is the
full one. Nothing is deferred: every tool, argument, `kind` and `operation` is in
`tools/list`, with its enum, its `required` set and its `type`. What the copy
folds:

- **Union field schemas repeated inside branches.** Where a node has both
  `properties` and a `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, a branch that repeats a union field
  keeps only what it adds or tightens. Both apply to the same instance, so
  `union AND branch'` accepts exactly what `union AND branch` accepts; `type` is
  always kept and a fully repeated field becomes `{"type": ...}`, never `{}` or a
  boolean. MEASURED 2026-09-26: `horizun_create_elements` 81,409 -> 30,707 bytes,
  `horizun_document_session` 17,551 -> 9,034.
- **The `idempotency_key` text** (305 characters, 65 places) is shown in a short
  form; the contract keeps every word.
- **Descriptions over 250 characters** are capped, as before.

The exact schema is one read away:

| Resource | Serves |
|---|---|
| `horizun://contract/tools` | every contract row |
| `horizun://contract/tools/{tool}` | one tool's row, full `input_schema` |
| `horizun://contract/tools/{tool}/{variant}` | one discriminated branch verbatim, with the fields it requires |

Variants are found in the contract by rule (a `oneOf`/`anyOf` whose branches are
each selected by one `const` of the same field, listed in that field's enum):
today `horizun_create_elements` `kind` (32) and `horizun_document_session`
`operation` (5). `resources/templates/list` returns both templates and
`completion/complete` fills `{tool}` and `{variant}`.

**`schema_help`.** A call that failed (`isError`, or a rehearsal with
`invalid > 0`) and whose arguments violate the full contract gets advice. A
reply that already has `structuredContent` (a rehearsal, or an error with a
fallback block or trace) carries `structuredContent.schema_help`: `contract_uri`,
up to 20 `pointer: message` violations and, for a discriminated tool, one entry
per kind/operation in the arguments with its `uri` and (for up to 3 branches,
12 KB) the verbatim branch; an unknown value gets `valid_values`. It is bounded
at 16 KB. A failing `oneOf` is explained by the branch the row names by its
`const` (a wall row is told what a wall needs), and by the closest branch only
when it names none. An error with no `structuredContent` gets none created: it
gains one text line with the first violation and the URI of the schema that holds
it, because readers that take `structuredContent` in place of the text (the
procedure judge; clients that forward it to the model) would otherwise see the
advice and lose the error. In every case this is advice attached after the
verdict: a success keeps its text exactly the payload, an error gains one line,
and `isError`, `invalid`, `errors`, `fallback` and `capability_gaps` are
unchanged.

**Names inside a branch.** Every argument name is kept at every instance
location. Inside one branch, a field whose whole nested object schema equals the
union field's (for example `source_reference` in 27 `create_elements` kinds) is
shown as `{"type":"object"}`, and its nested names are read in the union field one
level up; `AdvertisedSchemaEquivalenceTests` rehydrates every such fold. Keeping
stub copies of those names in each branch would cost about 8 KB (estimated from
the field's 9 keys), the margin this work exists to create.

**What a call is validated against.** There is no generic JSON-Schema check
before dispatch, and this change does not add one. Validation reads the FULL
contract where it always did: `ToolInputRules` in the add-in, each command's
parser, the host tools' unknown-argument refusals, and the procedure/workflow
checks of top-level `required`/`additionalProperties`. The advertised copy is
read only by `tools/list` and tests.

**Client evidence** (from source, not a live run): codex-rs
`sanitize_json_schema` keeps `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`/`enum`/`items`/`required`/
`additionalProperties`, turns `const` into `enum`, drops `maxItems`/`if`/`then`/
`default`, and coerces boolean schemas to `{type: string}` (hence no boolean
subschemas). Claude Code flattens a top-level `oneOf` into an "Input constraint"
line and passes a nested `oneOf` through. The copy adds no keyword kinds.

**The ledger.** `tests/Horizun.Server.Tests/tools-list-ledger.json` records, per
tool, the SHA-256 of the advertised description and schema and the entry's bytes,
plus the totals of every permission profile and tool pack (MEASURED 2026-09-26:
524,199 -> 460,166 bytes for all 122 tools; ceiling 524,288). A change that moves
any of it fails naming the tool and the signed delta. To accept it deliberately,
set `HORIZUN_UPDATE_TOOLS_LEDGER=1`, run `dotnet test tests/Horizun.Server.Tests
-c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ToolsListLedger"`, then review and commit the diff
with the change that caused it (the rewrite fails once, and refuses under `CI`).

**Reserve levers** (measured on the prototype, not implemented): defer the
discriminated branches behind the variant template plus a host-resident describe
tool (about -14.8 KB; a new contract row moves `Contract.Hash`); cap descriptions
at 230 instead of 250 (-5.2 KB, lossy); omit spec-default annotations (-7.5 KB,
client-display risk).

## Wire parse errors and cancellation retries

### Parse errors (-32700)

A line on stdin that is not valid JSON is answered with JSON-RPC error -32700,
`id: null`, and an `error.data` object:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `hint` | `unescaped_backslash` (a Windows path such as `C:\x` not written as `C:\\x`), `concatenated_messages` (two messages on one line), `truncated_message` (the line ended inside a string or object, usually a raw newline inside a string value), `byte_order_mark`, `bare_word` (an unquoted word where JSON needs a quoted string, `:` or `,`), `not_json`, `invalid_json` |
| `line`, `column`, `offset`, `length` | where the parser stopped; `offset` is the zero-based character index in the received line |
| `shape`, `shape_caret` | a window of up to 20 characters either side of `offset`, with every letter shown as `a`, every digit as `0` and every non-ASCII character as `?`; quotes, backslashes and punctuation are kept |
| `content_echoed` | always `false`. The words, numbers, paths and tokens you sent are never repeated |

The server log line carries the same fields and the client name that
`initialize` declared (`clientInfo.name`, reduced to 40 safe characters).

Build every message with a JSON serializer (`ConvertTo-Json`, `json.dumps`) and end each one with a newline.
`scripts/hz-call.ps1` checks its arguments before it starts a server. It takes
`-ArgumentsObject @{ path = 'C:\folder\a.rvt' }` so a caller never has to escape
JSON by hand.

### Cancellation and timeout: what a retry does

When a tool call is cancelled by the client or times out, the error detail
(`revit_transport_failed`) includes a `retry` object, and the message ends with a
matching `RETRY:` sentence:

| `retry.verdict` | when | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `same_key_runs_fresh` | the request was removed from Revit's queue before it started, or was never sent | send the identical call again. If it had an `idempotency_key` and `confirmation_token`, reuse them: neither was consumed |
| `same_key_replays_recorded_answer` | the request may have started, and it carried an `idempotency_key` | send the identical call with the **same** key. Revit runs one command at a time, so the retry waits behind the original and then replays the recorded answer from the durable ledger without writing again. A new key would write a second time |
| `inspect_model_first` | the request may have started, and it carried no key | nothing can prove what happened, so inspect the model before sending anything |

If the call waited 60 s or more, the sentence also names `horizun_submit_job`
and `horizun_job_status`, and `retry.prefer` is set to `horizun_submit_job`.
The size of the batch (`retry.batch_items`) is reported but does not trigger
this advice: in 1,447 logged `horizun_create_elements` calls the slowest took
3.4 s. Progress: any `tools/call` that sends `_meta.progressToken` already gets
`notifications/progress` every 5 s, with the bridge's queue or run state when
the bridge can see it.

---

**Resumen (español).** Un -32700 ahora dice dónde falló (línea, columna,
posición), qué tipo de fallo parece (`hint`: barra invertida sin escapar, dos
mensajes en una línea, mensaje cortado, BOM, palabra sin comillas) y una ventana
de texto donde cada letra se muestra como `a` y cada dígito como `0`. Nunca se
repite el contenido enviado. Una llamada cancelada o que agotó el tiempo indica
qué pasa si se reintenta. Si el trabajo no empezó, la misma llamada corre de
nuevo. Si pudo empezar y lleva `idempotency_key`, la misma clave devuelve la
respuesta registrada sin escribir otra vez; una clave nueva duplicaría la
escritura. Si pudo empezar y no lleva clave, hay que revisar el modelo antes de
reenviar nada. Si la llamada esperó 60 s o más, se recomienda
`horizun_submit_job`.



## Phases, design options, parts and assemblies

Two tools, each with an `operation` switch. Reads need no token. Every write takes
`target_document`, runs as a dry run by default and returns a single-use
`confirmation_token`; the apply spends it.

**How a write is verified.** The write runs inside a `TransactionGroup`. The dry
run applies it (every inner transaction commits), reads a `PostconditionCheck`
back from the model and rolls the whole group back. The apply does the same
write, checks it while the group can still be undone (any unverified property
rolls everything back), assimilates, then reads the checklist again from the
committed model. That second reading is what the reply publishes in
`postconditions`.

### `horizun_manage_phases`

| operation | writes | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | no | Phases in Revit's order; each phase filter with `presentation` for `new`, `existing`, `demolished`, `temporary` (`by_category`, `overridden`, `hidden`); design options with option set, `is_primary`, member count and the first 100 member ids; the active option. `design_options_writable` is always `false`. |
| `element_status` | no | For `element_ids`: created and demolished phase, `ElementOnPhaseStatus` in `phase_id` (default: last phase), and the design option (`main_model` when the element is in none). |
| `set_element_phases` | yes | Sets `created_phase_id` and/or `demolished_phase_id` (`-1` clears the demolition). The final pair is checked in order: demolition in the same phase is allowed (Temporary), before the creation is refused. Only elements where `HasPhases` and `ArePhasesModifiable` are true. |
| `create_phase_filter` | yes | `PhaseFilter.Create` with a unique `name`, then the presentations you name. |
| `edit_phase_filter` | yes | `filter_id` plus a new `name` and/or `presentation`. |
| `rename_phase` | yes | `phase_id` plus a unique `name`. |
| `create_phase` | refused | `no_phase_creation_api`. |
| `assign_design_option` | refused | `no_design_option_assignment_api`. |

**API limits (checked in RevitAPI.xml for 2023–2027, the same in every year).** No
call creates, inserts, deletes or reorders a phase. `Element.DesignOption` is
read-only, and nothing adds elements to an option set, moves them between options
or sets the active option. Python cannot do these things either, so the refusals
offer no fallback. Moving an element into a secondary option hides it from every
view that shows the primary option or the main model. That is why the refusal
tells you to review views before you do it by hand.

### `horizun_manage_assemblies_parts`

| operation | writes | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | no | Every part (id, excluded, source ids, original category), every assembly (name, naming category, members). With `element_ids`: whether each one is valid for parts, its part ids and its assembly. |
| `create_parts` | yes | `PartUtils.CreateParts` on `element_ids`. It refuses elements that already have parts or that fail `AreElementsValidForCreateParts`. Verified: each source has associated parts. |
| `divide_parts` | yes | `PartUtils.DivideParts` of part `element_ids` by `reference_ids`, which must be levels, grids or reference planes. The API requires a sketch plane even without curves, so a horizontal one is created. Verified: each divided part has at least two derived parts. The cut geometry itself is not checked. |
| `exclude_parts` / `restore_parts` | yes | Sets `Part.Excluded`, re-read per part. |
| `dissolve_parts` | yes | Deletes the `PartMaker` of each original in `element_ids`. This is the only way the API removes parts, and it loses every division, exclusion and part parameter. Verified: the originals still exist and have no parts. |
| `create_assembly` | yes | `AssemblyInstance.Create` with `naming_category_id` (default: the first member's category, checked with `IsValidNamingCategory`) and an optional unique `name`. The name is set in a second transaction because Revit only allows it after the creating transaction commits. Verified: members, naming category, name. |
| `assembly_views` | yes | `views` from `3d`, `plan`, `section_a`, `section_b`, `elevation_front`, `part_list`. Verified: each view's `AssociatedAssemblyInstanceId`. |
| `disassemble` | yes | `AssemblyInstance.Disassemble`. Verified: the instance is gone and every former member exists outside any assembly. |

The tool is marked destructive because `dissolve_parts` and `disassemble` remove elements.

### Live probes

`scripts/live-probes/phases-options-parts.probes.ps1` runs in the write tier of
`verify-live.ps1`. It creates three walls of its own at x ≥ 720 m and runs these
cases:

1. `list` reads the phases and the phase filters.
2. `create_phase` refuses with the API reason.
3. `set_element_phases` sets the first/last phase on one wall, reads the wall back as demolished, then restores it.
4. Design options `list`. It reports `not_covered` when the fixture has no options.
5. `create_parts` then `dissolve_parts` on one wall.
6. `create_assembly` of the other two walls, then `disassemble`.

The probe deletes the three walls afterwards. `phases-options-parts.tests.ps1` runs
the module offline against a fake `Call` and `Apply`. `divide_parts`,
`exclude_parts`, `assembly_views`, the phase-filter writes and `rename_phase` have
no live probe yet.

### Resumen (español)

- `horizun_manage_phases` lee:
  - las fases en orden;
  - los filtros de fase, con su presentación por estado nuevo, existente, demolido y temporal;
  - las opciones de diseño y el estado de fase de cada elemento.
- `horizun_manage_phases` escribe fases de elementos, crea y edita filtros de fase y renombra fases.
- La API de Revit 2023–2027 no permite dos cosas, y la herramienta las rechaza con el motivo y sin fallback a Python:
  - crear o reordenar fases;
  - mover elementos entre opciones de diseño.
- `horizun_manage_assemblies_parts` lista, crea, divide, excluye, restaura y disuelve partes. También crea ensamblajes, genera sus vistas y los desensambla.
- Cada escritura:
  1. se ensaya dentro de un TransactionGroup que se revierte;
  2. se aplica con el token;
  3. se relee del modelo confirmado.

  Si algo no cuadra, se revierte entera.



## Views, schedules and DWG layers

Extends three existing tools instead of adding new ones. Every write keeps the
existing contract: dry run by default, a confirmation token bound to what the ids
resolve to, one transaction, and a re-read after the commit.

### `horizun_manage_views` — filters, V/G and templates

| Operation | What it does | What is re-read |
|---|---|---|
| `edit_filter` | Replaces the rules of an existing filter (`filter_id`, `filter_name` or `filter_key`), optionally its `categories`; `rules` + `match` as in `create_filter`. Revit's own `ElementFilterIsAcceptableForParameterFilterElement` is asked before any transaction. | The filter's rules as Revit hands them back, as a text signature (`AND(`/`OR(`, rule class, parameter id, evaluator, value), compared with the signature of the filter that was written; the categories. The reply carries `rules_reread`. |
| `order_filters` | Puts `filter_ids` (ALL the filters of the view, top first) in that order. Revit has no `SetFilterOrder` in 2023–2027, so every filter is removed and added back, restoring its overrides, visibility and enabled flag. | `GetOrderedFilters()` and every filter's restored state. |
| `apply_filter` + `enabled` | The filter's *Enable Filter* flag (`SetIsFilterEnabled`). | `GetIsFilterEnabled`. |
| `explain_graphics` | READ. For 1–20 `element_ids` in a view: every layer that can decide how the element looks — element override, each filter in order (enabled, matches, visible, overrides), the category row — and the winner per property plus the visibility verdict. When the view's template governs filters or V/G, those rows come from the template and say `from_template`. The dry run already carries the report. | Recomputed after the commit on the apply path. |
| `set_category_visibility` | Now takes `subcategory` (by name), `overrides` (colours, weight, `line_pattern` by name or `Solid`, transparency, halftone) and/or `hidden`. A view whose template governs the category's V/G row is refused naming the template and the alternative: the same action with `view_id=<template>`, or `set_template_controls controlled=false`. | Hidden flag and each override field that was set. |
| `create_template` | `View.CreateViewTemplate` from `view_id`, named `name`. | `IsTemplate` and the name. |
| `set_template_controls` | Template `view_id`, `parameters` (BuiltInParameter names such as `VIS_GRAPHICS_MODEL`, or labels), `controlled` true/false. A parameter the template cannot govern is refused listing the ones it can. | `GetNonControlledTemplateParameterIds`. |
| `apply_template` with `template_view_id: -1` | Removes the template. | `ViewTemplateId` is invalid. |

Precedence used by `explain_graphics` (Revit's, not ours): element override, then
filters top-down (a higher filter wins property by property; disabled or
non-matching filters contribute nothing), then the category row, then object
styles. Visibility is not a precedence: any layer that hides wins.

### `horizun_create_schedule` — multi-category and key schedules

- `category: "OST_MultiCategory"` (or `multi_category`) creates a multi-category
  schedule (`ViewSchedule.CreateSchedule` with `InvalidElementId`, the same on
  2023–2027; `BuiltInCategory` has no `OST_MultiCategory`). `Category` is accepted
  as a field alias. The re-read checks the committed category id is invalid.
- `key_schedule: true` + `key_rows` (0–500) creates a key schedule over one
  category and inserts that many key rows. The re-read checks `IsKeySchedule` and
  counts the key elements owned by the schedule. `include_links` and `itemized` do
  not apply to key schedules and are refused when sent.
- **Grouping of a non-itemized schedule.** Without `group_by`, the schedule sorts
  and groups by the IDENTITY fields only (type, family, level, mark, text, yes/no)
  in the order they were requested, never by a QUANTITY: the Count field, a
  material quantity, percentage or formula, a measurable spec (length, area,
  volume...), an integer or number, or any field Revit can total. The quantity
  fields Revit can total (except Count) get `Totals`, so a grouped row shows the
  sum instead of a blank cell. Measured on a real model: walls with
  Type/Count/Length/Area/Volume grouped by every non-Count field gave 119 rows
  instead of 8. `group_by: [...]` (names from `fields`) is honoured exactly, in
  order, also on an itemized schedule; `[]` groups by nothing; a name that is not
  a requested field is refused in the rehearsal. The re-read covers `sort_group`
  (the committed sort/group field ids, in order) and `totals`, and the reply's
  `grouping` block says which role each field got and why.

### `horizun_export` — the DWG layer table

- `format: "dwg_layers"`, `output_path` ending in `.json`, `dwg_setup.name`:
  reads the named DWG export setup's layer table and writes it to the file. If the
  setup does not exist it is created (from `dwg_setup.source`, or with Revit's
  defaults). `dwg_setup.layers` rows (`category` as a BuiltInCategory token or the
  display name, optional `subcategory`, `layer`, `color`, `cut_layer`, `cut_color`
  with AutoCAD index colours 1–255) edit existing rows; a row the table does not
  have is refused, never added.
- **Persistence is measured, not assumed.** After `SetExportLayerTable` +
  `SetDWGExportOptions`, the table is re-read from a fresh `FindByName` before the
  commit (a mismatch rolls back and names the rows) and again after it; each edit
  reports `persisted`. Save/close/reopen is not part of the measurement.
- `format: "dwg"` with `dwg_setup: { "name": ... }` exports using that setup
  (`DWGExportOptions.GetPredefinedOptions`); `acad_version` still overrides the
  file version. The layer mapping is not proved from the DWG binary.

API availability, checked in each `RevitAPI.xml` 2023–2027: `View.GetOrderedFilters`,
`SetIsFilterEnabled`, `ParameterFilterElement.SetElementFilter`,
`ViewSchedule.CreateKeySchedule`, `BaseExportOptions.Get/SetExportLayerTable`,
`ExportDWGSettings.Create/FindByName/SetDWGExportOptions` exist in all five years;
`SetFilterOrder` exists in none. Whether each year keeps the layer-table write is
recorded per year by the live probe `scripts/live-probes/views-schedules-dwg.probes.ps1`.

**Resumen (español).** `horizun_manage_views` suma editar reglas de filtros,
reordenar/habilitar filtros, un informe de precedencia (elemento > filtros en
orden > categoría > estilos de objeto; si la plantilla gobierna V/G, esas filas son
de la plantilla), V/G por categoría y subcategoría con patrón de línea, y
plantillas (crear, qué parámetros gobiernan, aplicar/quitar con `-1`). Una vista
cuya plantilla gobierna V/G se rechaza indicando editar la plantilla.
`horizun_create_schedule` crea tablas multicategoría (`OST_MultiCategory`) y de
claves (`key_schedule`, `key_rows`). `horizun_export` lee y escribe la tabla de
capas de una configuración DWG con nombre (`format: dwg_layers`) y exporta con
ella; la persistencia se mide releyendo antes y después del commit, por año.



### `horizun_export` — view sets, gbXML and family files

- **DWG/DGN/DWFX view sets.** `format=dwg` with more than one `view_ids` (or with
  `file_naming`/`dwg_xrefs`), `format=dgn` and `format=dwfx` write **one file per
  view or sheet**, one exporter call each. `file_naming`: `ordinal`
  (`<stem>-001-<id>`, the PDF shape, default), `view_name` (`<stem>-<view name>`)
  or `sheet_number` (`<stem>-<number>-<name>`, sheets only). Names are sanitized
  (dots too — exporters read what follows the last dot as an extension) and a
  rule that gives two views one file refuses before anything is written.
  `dwg_xrefs`: `linked` (default, `MergedViews=false`: a sheet's views and links
  are xref files beside it) or `bound` (merged into the sheet's file). Each call
  is snapshotted on its own, so the files that changed during call *i* belong to
  view *i*; a view is verified when its planned file was written, is non-empty
  and starts with the format's signature (`AC10xx`; an OLE container or a V7
  header for DGN; a zip package for DWFX) - with `acad_version`, a DWG signature of
  that version. Companion files the call writes beside the target - a sheet's views
  and a view's visible links, for DWG `linked` and for DGN (whose `MergedViews` stays
  at Revit's default, false) - must be named `<stem>-...` and pass the same check;
  any other extra file, and a file of the view's name family left empty or
  unreadable, fails the view. Only the view's name family is hashed around each
  call; the rest of the folder is stamped by size and time. With more than 20 views the dry run says
  `long_set: true`: send the apply through `horizun_submit_job`. DWFX runs in a
  transaction that is rolled back (RevitAPI.xml documents the overload as
  throwing on a non-modifiable document).
- **gbXML** (`.xml`). Refused as **`no spaces`** when the document has no placed,
  bounded room or MEP space of the energy settings' export category and phase (dry
  run), or when the model built on apply holds no analytical space (checked before
  the file is written) — no empty campus is written. The export needs a main
  energy analysis model: one is built from rooms/spaces (SpatialElement, tier Final -
  Revit's default, the only tier that computes constructions), with the energy settings' analysis mode set to
  `RoomsOrSpaces` in every year — 2027 builds the model from that mode, and the
  export's model type is `AnalysisMode`, which follows it (2026's default; set
  explicitly in 2023–2025, where the documented default `SpatialElement` was
  measured refused as "not compatible" on that very model) —
  inside a transaction that is **rolled back** after the file is on disk, so the
  model, its energy settings and any energy model it had are left as they were.
  The written XML is re-read and its `Campus`/`Space`/`Zone`/`Surface`/`Opening`
  counts reported in `read_back`; a file without a Space fails.
- **Family `.rfa`.** `output_path` is an existing **folder**; exactly one of
  `family_ids` (Family element ids) or `category` (`OST_` token or the name Revit
  shows). Each loadable family is opened with `Document.EditFamily` (outside any
  transaction — an in-memory copy), saved with
  `SaveAsOptions{OverwriteExistingFile=false}` and closed without saving. In-place
  families, non-editable families and system family types are refused **by
  name**: with `family_ids` the whole call refuses, a `category` sweep lists them
  in `refused`. `overwrite=true` and existing target files refuse. Each file is
  verified by size and by `BasicFileInfo.Extract` reading its saved-in format.

### `horizun_export` — COBie workbook (`format: "cobie"`)

A COBie 2.4 workbook (`.xlsx`) of the active model: the asset-information handover of
ISO 19650 (see [INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT.md](INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT.md#cobie-handover)).
`output_path` ends in `.xlsx`; the mapping is the `cobie` object, and it is the
caller's data: nothing is taken from this machine or from any organisation's
convention. Every other `horizun_export` argument that belongs to another format is
refused by name, and so is an unknown `cobie` field, a column a field map cannot
fill, and a category that is not a model category of the document - every problem
named at once.

**Arguments (`cobie`)**

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `created_by` | yes | The COBie CreatedBy contact e-mail, written on every row; refused when it is not an e-mail address. Never taken from this machine, and project-context v1 has no contact field to take it from. |
| `created_on` | no | ISO-8601 date or date-time (no offset: read as UTC). Default: the export time, UTC; `created_on_source` says which. Written as `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss` text. |
| `facility.name` | yes | Facility.Name. |
| `facility.category`, `project_name`, `site_name`, `currency_unit`, `phase` | no | Facility columns the sheet requires: left out, each is an empty cell and a finding. `facility.phase` is COBie's Facility.Phase (the project stage), not a Revit phase. |
| `facility.description`, `project_description`, `site_description` | no | Written when given. |
| `facility.area_measurement` | no | Default: the basis Revit computed the areas on, read from the document (`Revit room area, computed at the wall finish`). |
| `phase` | yes | The **Revit** phase: its rooms (or spaces) are the Space rows, components are placed in them and must be New or Existing in it. No default - a hidden "last phase" would describe a different building. |
| `component_categories` | yes | `OST_` tokens of model categories whose instances are Components; their types are the Type rows. No default list. |
| `space_source` | no | `rooms` (default) or `spaces` (MEP spaces). |
| `category_parameter` | no | The parameter written to Category on Floor, Space, Type and System: on the element, else - when the element has no parameter of that name - on its type. Absent or empty: an empty cell and a finding, never `n/a`. |
| `zone_parameter`, `zone_category` | no | A room/space parameter whose value names its zone, and the Zone rows' Category (`zone_category` needs `zone_parameter`). Without `zone_parameter` the Zone sheet holds only its header. |
| `component_name_parameter` | no | e.g. `Mark`. Component.Name comes from it when the value is present and unique among the components (without case and outer spaces); otherwise `<Type name>-<element id>` and an advisory `name_fallback` finding. Without it every component is named `<Type name>-<element id>`. |
| `type_fields` | no | `{Type column: parameter}` for any Type column except Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category and Ext* - e.g. `Manufacturer`, `ModelNumber`, `AssetType`, `Description`. Read on the type. |
| `component_fields` | no | `{Component column: parameter}` for Description, SerialNumber, InstallationDate, WarrantyStartDate, TagNumber, BarCode, AssetIdentifier. Read on the instance, else its type. |
| `project_context_path` | no | A `project-context.json` (schema_version 1, as `horizun_project_context` writes it), read by the add-in itself. It fills what the arguments left out: `project.name` → facility.project_name, `project.location` → facility.site_name, `project.description` → facility.project_description, `appointment.stage` → facility.phase, `classification.type_parameter` → category_parameter. An argument always wins, `cobie.provenance` says where each value came from, and the file's SHA-256 joins the approval. |
| `max_findings` | no | How many findings the reply lists (1..5000, default 500); the counts are always complete. |

A mapped parameter is written as text as Revit shows it: `AsString` for text,
`AsValueString` (the document's units and formatting) for everything else.

**Sheets and columns.** The seven sheets in COBie order, each with its full COBie 2.4
column set; a column with no source is written empty. **Bold** columns are required
by this tool - an empty one is a finding.

| Sheet | Rows | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| Facility | one | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category, ProjectName, SiteName, LinearUnits, AreaUnits, VolumeUnits, CurrencyUnit, AreaMeasurement**, ExternalSystem, ExternalProjectObject, ExternalProjectIdentifier, ExternalSiteObject, ExternalSiteIdentifier, ExternalFacilityObject, ExternalFacilityIdentifier, Description, ProjectDescription, SiteDescription, **Phase** |
| Floor | levels marked Building Story, lowest first | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category**, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, Description, Elevation, Height |
| Space | rooms (or MEP spaces) of the phase, placed, area > 0 | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category, FloorName, Description**, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, RoomTag, UsableHeight, GrossArea, NetArea |
| Zone | one row per zone per space | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category, SpaceNames**, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, Description |
| Type | the types of the components in scope | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category, Description**, AssetType, Manufacturer, ModelNumber, WarrantyGuarantorParts, WarrantyDurationParts, WarrantyGuarantorLabor, WarrantyDurationLabor, WarrantyDurationUnit, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, ReplacementCost, ExpectedLife, DurationUnit, WarrantyDescription, NominalLength, NominalWidth, NominalHeight, ModelReference, Shape, Size, Color, Finish, Grade, Material, Constituents, Features, AccessibilityPerformance, CodePerformance, SustainabilityPerformance |
| Component | the instances in scope | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, TypeName, Space, Description**, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, SerialNumber, InstallationDate, WarrantyStartDate, TagNumber, BarCode, AssetIdentifier |
| System | one row per system per in-scope component | **Name, CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Category, ComponentNames**, ExtSystem, ExtObject, ExtIdentifier, Description |

The required set is identity, classification and the references between sheets.
Product data (AssetType, manufacturer, model, warranties, cost, expected life,
nominal sizes) is not required here: the handover's own requirements decide it - map
it with `type_fields` and judge it with the project's COBie check.

What fills each row:
- **Facility**: the caller's values. LinearUnits, AreaUnits and VolumeUnits are the
  document's display units as COBie pick-list names (millimeters, centimeters, meters,
  feet, inches; square ...; cubic ...). A composite display unit is written in its
  decimal unit (feet and fractional inches → feet, meters and centimeters → meters),
  a unit COBie has no name for in SI, and `cobie.units.notes` says which.
- **Floor**: Name = the level's name; Elevation = `Level.Elevation` (relative to the
  level type's Elevation Base) in the linear unit. Description and Height stay empty.
- **Space**: Name = Number; Description = the room's own Name parameter; FloorName =
  its level; RoomTag = Number; UsableHeight = the unbounded height; NetArea = Revit's
  area, computed at the document's room boundary location (stated in
  AreaMeasurement). GrossArea stays empty: Revit computes one area per room, and it is
  not written twice. A room whose Phase cannot be read is counted
  (`scope.spaces.phase_unreadable`), never assumed to be in the phase.
- **Zone**: Name = the zone value, Category = `zone_category`, SpaceNames = the
  space's Name. Key: Name + Category + SpaceNames.
- **Type**: Name = `Family: Type`; Description = its Description parameter unless
  `type_fields` maps Description.
- **Component**: TypeName = its Type row's Name; Space = the Name of the space(s) it
  sits in, comma-separated; Description = its type's Description unless
  `component_fields` maps it. In scope: instances of the categories whose status in
  the phase is New or Existing (or undefined), not nested in another family, not
  view-specific; the rest are counted in `cobie.scope.components.excluded`.
- **System**: MechanicalSystem, PipingSystem and ElectricalSystem. ComponentNames =
  each in-scope component among the system's elements and its base equipment
  (`MEPSystem.Elements` does not include the base equipment). A system with no
  component in scope is not written; `cobie.systems` counts and samples them. Key:
  Name + Category + ComponentNames.
- **Ext\***: ExtSystem = the authoring application (e.g. `Autodesk Revit 2026`),
  ExtObject = the Revit class (Level, Room, FamilySymbol, FamilyInstance,
  MechanicalSystem, ...), ExtIdentifier = the element's UniqueId, so every row traces
  back to its element.
- Rows are sorted by name (ordinal), then element id: the same model gives the same
  workbook, cell for cell.

**Where a component sits** reuses the product's rules; there is no new geometry:
- a door or window with `space_source: rooms`: Revit's own To Room and From Room in
  the phase - the values its door schedules show, and the rule
  `horizun_write_params_verified` numbers doors by;
- a door or window with `space_source: spaces`: the space on each side of its host
  wall, half the wall plus 0.5 ft from the insert at its mid-height - how
  `horizun_quantities room_finishes` decides what an opening faces;
- everything else, and an opening those rules find nothing for: `RoomMembershipReader`,
  the rule of `include_room` and `group_by='room'` (see "Room membership" below).

`cobie.scope.components.space_basis` counts each basis. A component in no space has an
empty Space cell and a `required_field` finding whose detail is the membership's own
reason. A component other than a door or window that sits in two or more spaces lists
them all and gets an advisory `spans_spaces`.

**Findings are reported, never silently fixed.**

| Kind | Blocking | When |
|---|---|---|
| `required_field` | yes | a required cell is empty; `detail` says why (argument not given, parameter missing, empty or unreadable, no space found ...) |
| `duplicate_name` | yes | two Floor, Space, Type or Component rows share a Name, or two Zone or System rows share their key (compared without case and outer spaces); or two different Revit systems share Name + Category, which a COBie reader would merge into one |
| `broken_reference` | yes | a Space's FloorName names no Floor row (its level is not a Building Story), or a Component's Space names no Space row |
| `name_fallback` | no | `component_name_parameter` was given and the component's value was missing, empty or shared |
| `spans_spaces` | no | a component other than a door or window sits in several spaces |
| `not_in_zone` | no | `zone_parameter` is empty or missing on a space |
| `parameter_missing` | no | a mapped parameter exists on none of the elements behind a sheet - usually a misspelt name |
| `empty_scope` | no | no instance of `component_categories` is in scope |

Each finding is `{kind, blocking, sheet, row, column, detail, element_id}`, listed in
sheet, row and column order; `cobie.findings` has the totals by kind and by sheet.

**`deliverable_ready`** is the workbook's verdict: true only when no blocking finding
remains (the dry run says `deliverable_ready_if_written`). A workbook with blocking
findings **is still written** on apply - a COBie with gaps is a deliverable under
review, not a lie - and `deliverable_ready: false` with `blocking` says why. It is
this tool's rules, not a COBie QC certification.

**Dry run, token, apply, re-read.**
- The dry run reads the model, builds every row and finding, and writes nothing. The
  token binds the destination, which files exist, the `cobie` object, the project
  context's SHA-256 and a digest of every cell except CreatedOn
  (`cobie.content_sha256`): a model that moves in a way the workbook would show - a
  renamed room, a new door, a changed parameter - makes the apply a stale plan.
- The apply reads the model again and writes the workbook to a temporary file beside
  the target with the Core writer (`Core/XlsxWorkbookWriter.cs`: System.IO.Compression
  and XML, no dependency; inline strings, numbers, a bold frozen header row), then puts
  it in place - replacing a file only with `overwrite: true`; with `overwrite: false` an
  existing file refuses in the rehearsal, and again if one appears before the move.
- It then **re-reads the file from disk** (`Core/XlsxWorkbookReader.cs`) and compares
  sheet names and order, every sheet's row count and every cell - kind and exact text,
  a number being the text of its `<v>` - with the plan. `files_verified: 1` only when
  everything matches; otherwise the differing cells are named and success is not
  claimed. `files[0]` has the path, bytes and SHA-256 of the bytes that were read, and
  `read_back.cells_sha256` hashes what they hold.
- What the re-read proves: the file holds exactly the rows that were built and judged.
  What it does not prove: how Excel or a COBie checker renders or judges it, or that
  the model's data is right. Checked once offline (2026-09-27): a workbook these rules
  built from sample facts opened in Excel (no repair log) and LibreOffice, and
  openpyxl read every COBie cell as planned.
- Text XML cannot carry as is goes the way Excel writes it (`_xHHHH_`; a literal
  `_xHHHH_` is escaped as `_x005F_xHHHH_`), and CR as a character reference. Over 2,000
  components the dry run says `long_run`: send the apply through `horizun_submit_job`.

**Not done**: linked models are not read. There is no Contact sheet (CreatedBy names a
contact the project's own Contact sheet must hold) and no Assembly, Connection, Spare,
Resource, Job, Impact, Document, Attribute, Coordinate or Issue sheet.
`information_container` is refused for cobie.

Tests: `tests/Horizun.Core.Tests/XlsxWorkbookTests.cs` and `CobieWorkbookTests.cs`;
live probe `scripts/live-probes/cobie-workbook.probes.ps1` (its offline half is
`cobie-workbook.tests.ps1`), not yet run in Revit.

**Resumen (español).** `horizun_export` con `format: "cobie"` escribe un libro COBie
2.4 (`.xlsx`) del modelo activo: hojas Facility, Floor, Space, Zone, Type, Component y
System con el juego de columnas COBie 2.4 de cada una. El mapeo (`cobie`) es dato del
llamador: `created_by` (e-mail, obligatorio y nunca tomado de la máquina),
`facility.name`, la fase **de Revit** (`phase`, sin valor por defecto) y
`component_categories` (tokens `OST_`, sin lista por defecto); el resto es opcional, y
un `project-context.json` v1 rellena nombre de proyecto, sitio, etapa y
`category_parameter` cuando no se dan (el argumento siempre gana). Una celda
obligatoria sin fuente queda **vacía y es un hallazgo** (nunca "n/a"); nombres
duplicados y referencias rotas también lo son, y `deliverable_ready` es falso mientras
quede uno bloqueante, pero el libro se escribe igual. Dónde está cada componente usa
las reglas existentes: To/From Room de Revit para puertas y ventanas, el espacio a
cada lado del muro anfitrión para espacios MEP, y `RoomMembershipReader` para el resto.
El ensayo no escribe nada y su token ata cada celda salvo CreatedOn; la aplicación
escribe con un escritor propio sin dependencias y **relee el archivo del disco**,
comparando hojas, filas y cada celda con el plan antes de declarar `files_verified: 1`.

## Groups and worksets

### `horizun_manage_groups`

| operation | needs | what is re-read after the commit |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | - (optional `type_id`, `max_rows`) | read only: every group type (kind `model` / `detail` / `attached_detail`), its instances, member ids (500 per instance), nested groups, parent group, attached detail group types |
| `create` | `element_ids`, `name` | the group exists, its members equal `element_ids`, the type carries `name` |
| `add_members` / `remove_members` | one `group_ids` entry (the reference), `element_ids`, `scope` when the type has other instances | the reference's members, the type name, whether the old type was deleted or kept, the new type's instance count, and every other instance |
| `rename_type` | `type_id`, `name` | the name and an unchanged instance count |
| `duplicate_type` | `type_id`, `name` | the new type's name, zero instances on it, the source's count unchanged |
| `swap_type` | `group_ids`, target `type_id` | each instance's type and the target's instance count |
| `ungroup` | `group_ids` | each group is gone and each former member exists outside any group |
| `convert_to_link` | - | refused: `code: api_absent` |

**Redefining a group.** Revit has no edit-group API. The reference instance is
ungrouped, the member set changed, and a new group type is made from it. The
reference gets a NEW group id and its instance parameters are not carried. When
the type has other instances the call must say `scope`:

- `all_instances`: every other instance is swapped onto the new type, the old type
  is deleted and the new one takes its name. Their member ids change, and members
  removed from them are deleted, not left loose. The new type's origin is Revit's,
  so each swapped instance is moved back by a displacement MEASURED from a member
  whose (category, type) is unique before and after; then every member it held
  before is checked by category, type and bounding box (0.001 ft). No unique
  member, no measurement: the whole change rolls back.
- `this_instance`: only the reference moves to a new type named `name`; the other
  instances stay on the old type, untouched.

A type with attached detail group types is refused: the regroup would orphan them.

**Convert to link.** `GroupType` offers `LoadFrom` and nothing that saves a group as
a model, in every RevitAPI 2023–2027. Do it in Revit (select the group, Link).

### `horizun_manage_worksets`

Every operation, `list` included, needs a workshared model; otherwise the reply is
`code: not_workshared` and nothing is read or written.

| operation | needs | re-read |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | - | read only: user worksets with open, editable, owner, visible-by-default, element count, and the active workset |
| `create` | `name` | the workset exists with that name |
| `rename` | `workset_id`, `name` | the name (a workset owned by another user is refused) |
| `move_elements` | destination `workset_id`, `element_ids` OR `category` (BuiltInCategory, host only, ≤ 10,000) | each moved element's `WorksetId`, and that no skipped element moved |
| `set_default` | `workset_id` (open) | the active workset id |
| `visibility` | `workset_id`, `view_ids`, `visibility` = `visible` / `hidden` / `use_global` | each view's workset visibility |

Elements owned by another user are reported with the owner (`borrowed_by_other`)
and never forced; elements whose workset parameter is read-only (group members,
hosted sub-elements) are reported `workset_not_editable`. Both make the outcome
`partial`, not `verified_applied`. `set_default` changes a session setting, so its
dry run is a measured preview, not a provisional change.

### Resumen en español

`horizun_manage_groups` lista, crea, redefine (añadir/quitar miembros), renombra,
duplica, cambia de tipo y desagrupa grupos. Revit no tiene API de "editar grupo":
la instancia de referencia se desagrupa y se reagrupa (obtiene un id nuevo). Si el
tipo tiene otras instancias, `scope` es obligatorio: `all_instances` cambia todas
(se recolocan por un desplazamiento medido y se comprueba cada miembro) y
`this_instance` solo la de referencia, con un tipo nuevo. `convert_to_link` se
rechaza tipado (`api_absent`): no existe en la API 2023–2027.
`horizun_manage_worksets` solo opera sobre modelos workshared (si no,
`not_workshared`): lista, crea, renombra, mueve elementos (los prestados por otro
usuario se reportan, nunca se fuerzan), fija el workset activo y la visibilidad
por vista. Todo con ensayo por defecto, token de un solo uso y relectura tras el
commit.



## MEP routing and sizing

`horizun_mep_routing` is one multi-operation tool over the routing preferences and
size catalogs of pipes, ducts, conduits and cable trays. It is separate from
`horizun_manage_system_types` on purpose: that tool duplicates types and writes their
parameters; a routing rule is not a parameter, a size catalog is not an element type,
and a resize is an instance write whose side effects land on other elements.

| operation | writes | what it does | what is re-read after commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read` | no | `type_id`: the type's rules per `RoutingPreferenceRuleGroupType` (part, description, size ranges), preferred junction and the fittings a rule can name. Conduit/cable-tray types carry no routing preferences; their elbow/tee/cross/transition/union are listed instead. `segment_id`: material, schedule, roughness, every nominal/inner/outer size. `element_ids`: kind, size, catalog and whether the size is in it. Nothing: every MEP type, every pipe segment, and the duct (round/rectangular/oval), conduit (per standard) and cable-tray catalogs. | - |
| `set_rules` | yes | Ordered `add` / `remove` / `move` edits per group on a pipe or duct type, plus optional `junction` (Tee/Tap). An add without `min_size`/`max_size` covers all sizes. Indexes refer to the list as the previous edit left it. | Every touched group equals the list computed from the list read before plus the edits; every untouched group is unchanged; the junction. |
| `add_sizes` / `remove_sizes` | yes | `catalog` = `segment` (with `segment_id`), `conduit` (with `conduit_standard`), `duct_round`, `duct_rectangular`, `duct_oval` or `cable_tray`. Segment and conduit sizes need `inner` and `outer`; conduit sizes also `bend_radius`. A size already present (add) or absent (remove) is refused; a size still used by an element is refused before any write, naming the elements. | Each size present with its inner/outer/bend, or absent; every other size unchanged. |
| `resize` | yes | `element_ids` or `system_id` (piping or duct network), to `diameter` or `width`+`height`. Each value must be a size of that element's own catalog (the pipe's segment, the duct shape's list, the conduit type's standard, the cable-tray list). Runs already at that size are skipped and listed. | Each run's size parameters equal the request, and every connector connected before is still connected. The fittings Revit removed/replaced, retyped or inserted (transitions) are reported in `result`. |
| `size_by_flow` | no | Per pipe or round/rectangular duct: the smallest catalog size (`used_in_sizing`) whose free area carries the flow at or below `max_velocity` (m/s). Flow is the element's calculated flow, or `flow` (L/s) for all. Pipes use the segment's inner diameter; rectangular ducts hold the current `height` (or the one given) and pick the width. `resize_calls` groups the proposals into ready `resize` requests. | - |
| `route` | yes | `kind` (pipe/duct/conduit/cable_tray), `type_id`, `system_type_id` (pipe/duct), `level_id`, size (`diameter` for pipes, conduits and round ducts; `width`+`height` for rectangular/oval ducts and cable trays - a mismatch is refused before any write), `start`/`end` ([x,y,z]; points and sizes in `units`, default mm), `clearance_mm` (default 50), `grid_mm` (default 100, minimum 10), `max_nodes` (default 20000, maximum 200000), optional `preferred_elevation` ({min_mm, max_mm}; a missing side is unbounded). A pure 3-D orthogonal A* (`RouteSearch`, Revit-free, in `Core/RouteSearch.cs`) finds a polyline around every physical host element and every loaded-link element near the search box (a rotated link's boxes from all eight corners), inflated by `clearance_mm` plus half the run's OUTSIDE size (a pipe's outer diameter from its type's segment; `size_basis` says when the nominal was used). The end is snapped toward the start and its off-grid remainder absorbed into the last leg along that axis - no stub legs, never doubling back. Every leg keeps a minimum length (first/last: one outside size; between two bends: two) so each elbow has room; a path that cannot is `no_route` naming the short leg in mm. The search box (6 grid steps around start/end) grows to x3 and x9 before refusing, and the refusal says when the box, not `max_nodes`, was binding. The dry run declares the N segments and N-1 elbows it will create, and the token binds the rounded polyline: a route that changed by apply time is refused as stale. | Free ends (the route's own start/end) on their points (1 mm); at each bend, where the elbow trims both runs back, the elbow's nominal junction (intersection of its connector axes) on the planned vertex (1 mm), the physical end on the planned leg's axis pulled back toward the other end, and connected to that elbow; each segment's size re-read from the same parameters `resize` uses (1 mm; a size Revit snapped to its catalog fails, named), every elbow's connector count, and a `SpatialCoherence` check against every created element - any error against a physical host or link, or a check left partial (budget or cap hit, links not examined), throws and rolls back the whole route, named. |

| `hangers` | yes | `element_ids` of straight pipes, ducts, cable trays or conduits; `hanger_type_id` (a level-based generic model, pipe/duct accessory or specialty equipment type you supply; work-plane- and face-based families are refused before anything is placed); `spacing_mm` (maximum gap) and `end_offset_mm` (clearance from each run end and each tap fitting), both required; `max_rod_mm` (default 3000); `rod_length_parameter` (optional instance length parameter); `attach` = `structure_above`. Stations: each tap owns a clearance zone of `end_offset_mm` either side; the span between the end clearances is cut at those zones and every free segment gets a station at each edge plus an even split, so no gap inside it exceeds `spacing_mm`. End stations obey the tap clearance too (moved inward, `end_stations_moved_mm`). A gap that cannot be closed - across a zone wider than `spacing_mm`, or where a station has nothing above - is listed per run in `gaps_above_spacing` with its cause. Stations are counted before any ray: more than 1000 refuses. Each station casts a ray up from the run's top (centreline + half its outside height) against floors, structural framing and roofs of the host and of loaded links, in a temporary 3D view that is rolled back (no template, filters or section box; structure, links and open worksets visible; the run's phase with demolished hidden); closed worksets are listed, not searched. The nearest hit within `max_rod_mm` is the support (`source` host/linked, element id, link instance id) and its distance the rod length; `rod_length_parameter` must be an instance Length parameter. Stations with nothing above are listed as `no_support_above` and not placed; a ray that cannot be cast refuses the call; runs shorter than 2 x `end_offset_mm` get none. The instance goes on the run's centreline, turned to its horizontal direction. Risers are skipped and reported; only flex runs are refused with the Python fallback grant (wires and other curves are plain errors). | Each hanger's type, position (1 mm; Z from its level plus the offset that governs it), rotation (0.5 degree) and rod parameter (1 mm), and `count`: placed equals planned. |

Writes follow the bridge's two-step flow: the dry run (default) applies the change in
a transaction, verifies it, rolls it back and returns a `confirmation_token`; the apply
spends the token, re-verifies inside a TransactionGroup and rolls everything back on
any mismatch. Units are `mm` (default), `in` or `feet`; catalog sizes match at
1e-5 ft (about 0.003 mm).

**Limits.** `size_by_flow` claims velocity only: no friction, pressure drop or fluid
properties, because Revit's duct/pipe sizing dialog has no public API and a
friction-based size would be a guess. Oval ducts, conduits and cable trays are not
sized by flow. Flex pipes and flex ducts are outside `resize` and carry the Python
fallback grant. Moving a rule whose criterion is not a size range is refused rather
than dropping the criterion. The API members used (`RoutingPreferenceManager`,
`RoutingPreferenceRule`, `PrimarySizeCriterion`, `Segment`/`PipeSegment` sizes,
`DuctSizeSettings`, `ConduitSizeSettings`, `CableTraySizes`) read identically in the
2023-2027 API documentation, so there is no per-year branch.

**`route` example** (mm, apply after a `dry_run` returns a `confirmation_token`):

```json
{
  "operation": "route", "target_document": "...", "kind": "pipe",
  "type_id": 123456, "system_type_id": 234567, "level_id": 345678,
  "diameter": 100, "start": [0, 0, 3000], "end": [8000, 0, 3000],
  "clearance_mm": 75, "grid_mm": 150,
  "dry_run": false, "confirmation_token": "..."
}
```

The reply's `result` carries `length_mm`, `bends`, `polyline_mm`, `segment_ids` and
`elbow_ids`; a failed search returns `no_route: <reason> (blocking region: <name>)`
instead of a token, naming the obstacle that closed every path.

**`slope` (gravity pipe runs).** `element_ids` names the run's pipes (the fittings
joining them come along), or one seed pipe with `walk: true` follows the connected
network through pipe fittings (by category, OST_PipeFitting), up to 200 pipes plus
fittings. Accessories, fixtures, equipment and unnamed pipes are boundaries, never
walked through; their connections are listed as `external_connections` and must
still be connected afterwards, and a plan that would MOVE an end connected to one is
refused by name (hold that end, name the element, or disconnect it). A pipe with a
tap (a connection along its length) is refused. `slope_percent` is the grade (2.0 = 2%).
`fixed_end` holds one open end at its current elevation:

- `upstream` / `downstream` - only for a run with exactly two open ends, and only
  when a connector reports flow direction (a calculated system); otherwise refused.
  Readings that contradict each other (both ends In, or both Out) are refused.
- `<element_id>` - the pipe (or fitting) owning one open end. Direction comes from
  flow; when flow does not read (or contradicts the other end) it is refused - high
  and low give opposite slopes, so the bridge does not guess.
- `<element_id>:high` / `<element_id>:low` - the caller states whether the held end
  is the upstream end or the outlet. A branched run held at a high end needs flow
  to name the one outlet; otherwise hold the outlet with `:low`.

Every point sits slope x its horizontal path length to the outlet above the outlet,
so a tee's branch drains toward the main whichever end is held. Fittings move as
rigid bodies (their legs keep their rise), so pipes carry the whole drop at exactly
the target slope. Pipes steeper than 45 degrees are risers and keep their rise
(`risers_kept`). `min_clearance` (in `units`) refuses the run, naming the point, if
any point would land below the highest level at or below the held end plus that
clearance; without it, a point the re-grade would drag from above that level to
below it is refused. The rehearsal shows the held end, the outlet, target
elevations of every pipe end and fitting centre. Apply moves each fitting
vertically by its target minus its centre re-read at that moment, sets each pipe's
LocationCurve, regenerates, and reconnects a connector pair that separated but still
coincides (listed in `reconnected`); then it re-reads, in `units`, the held end,
every pipe end against its planned elevation, every pipe's signed slope (outlet
side lower, within 0.05 percentage points), every fitting centre, `min_clearance`,
every connector pair recorded before and every fitting's connected count, and rolls
back naming the element otherwise. The confirmation token binds every pipe's and
fitting's geometry and connections: a change between dry run and apply is
`stale_plan`. Revit has no pipe slope API (no `SlopeType` for pipes;
`PipeSettings.GetPipeSlopes` only lists preset slopes). AutoRouteFailures has an
`AttemptToConnectNonSlopingElementToSlopedPipeWarning` and an `...Error`; the
Warning does not fail a commit, so a separated fitting is caught only by the
post-commit connector re-read, and how elbows follow moved ends is measured by the
`pipe-slope` live probe (connector origins).

## Styles, units and electrical

Three multi-operation tools share one write ritual (`Commands/VerifiedModelEdit.cs`):
`dry_run` (the default) applies the edit inside a transaction, regenerates, re-reads
every requested property through a `PostconditionCheck` and rolls back, reporting
Revit's rollback status and a single-use `confirmation_token` bound to the measured
"before" state. The apply spends the token, runs inside a `TransactionGroup`,
re-reads before and after the inner commit and only assimilates a fully verified
checklist; anything else rolls the group back. The reply publishes the checklist
re-read from the committed model (`postconditions`) and an `application` block.
Read operations need no token and accept an optional `target_document` guard.

### `horizun_manage_styles`

| operation | what it does |
|---|---|
| `list_object_styles` | Without `category`: top-level model and annotation categories. With `category` (OST_ name, id or name): that category and its subcategories. Rows: projection/cut weight, colour, projection line pattern, material, `graphics_style_id`. |
| `set_object_style` | `category` (+ optional `subcategory`) and any of `projection_weight`, `cut_weight` (cuttable categories only), `color` (#RRGGBB), `line_pattern` (name or `Solid`), `material` (exact name). |
| `create_subcategory` | `category` (parent) + `name`, with the same optional style fields. Refused when the parent does not allow subcategories or the name exists. |
| `list_line_styles` / `create_line_style` | The same, fixed to the Lines category (a line style IS a Lines subcategory). |
| `list_line_patterns` / `create_line_pattern` | `name` + `segments` `[{type: dash|space|dot, length}]` in `units` (mm default); re-read segment by segment. |
| `list_fill_patterns` / `create_fill_pattern` | `name`, `target` drafting/model, `fill` solid/hatch/crosshatch, `angle` (degrees), `spacing`, `spacing2`; re-read solid flag, grid count, first grid angle and spacing. |

Nothing here deletes a style. Subcategories, line patterns and fill patterns are
removed with `horizun_delete_verified` on the published ids; built-in categories
cannot be deleted.

### `horizun_manage_units`

| operation | what it does |
|---|---|
| `read` | FormatOptions per spec: unit, accuracy, symbol, zero/space suppression, digit grouping; plus the document's decimal and grouping symbols. Default: length, area, volume, angle, slope, air flow, pipe flow, current, potential, power. `specs=[...]` or `all=true` for more. Specs are resolved against the running Revit by short name (`length`), unversioned id or full ForgeTypeId, because spec versions differ between years. |
| `set` | `spec` with any of `unit`, `accuracy`, `symbol` (`none` clears it), `suppress_*`, `use_digit_grouping`; and/or `decimal_symbol`, `digit_grouping_symbol`. Invalid accuracy/unit/symbol is refused naming the valid ones. |
| `project_information` | Without `values`: the named fields (name, number, client, address, status, issue_date, author, building_name, organization_name, organization_description) and every Project Information parameter. With `values`: text and integer parameters written by field or parameter name, each re-read. Other storage types go through `horizun_write_params_verified`. |
| `base_points` | Without `project_position`: Project Base Point and Survey Point (internal and shared positions, pinned) and the project position at the base point (E/W, N/S, elevation, angle to true north). With `project_position` (`east_west`, `north_south`, `elevation` in `units`, `angle_to_true_north` in degrees) **and** `confirm_shared_coordinates=true`: `ProjectLocation.SetProjectPosition` at the project base point. |

**Risk of `base_points` writes.** Re-specifying shared coordinates moves the model
against everything positioned by them: linked models placed by shared coordinates,
coordinate-based IFC/DWG/NWC exports and survey ties. In a workshared model it
needs ownership of the shared coordinates. Only the project coordinator should
decide it; the extra `confirm_shared_coordinates` flag exists so a token alone
cannot do it.

### `horizun_electrical`

| operation | what it does |
|---|---|
| `list_panels` | Electrical equipment: panel name, family/type, distribution system and its voltage, circuits fed, summed apparent load (VA), Revit's total connected load and demand current strings. |
| `list_circuits` | Every `ElectricalSystem` (optionally `panel_id`): type, panel, number, load name, member ids, apparent (VA) and true (W) load, voltage, poles, length (m), voltage drop (V up to 2025; Revit's own parameter string on 2026–2027, where the API property was deprecated and then removed). |
| `create_circuit` | `element_ids` (MEP family instances), `system_type` (default PowerCircuit), optional `panel_id`. Re-reads members, type and panel. |
| `assign_panel` | `circuit_id` + `panel_id` via `SelectPanel`; re-reads the base equipment. |
| `add_to_circuit` / `remove_from_circuit` | `circuit_id` + `element_ids`; re-reads the member set. Emptying a circuit is refused (delete it instead). |
| `panel_schedule` | `panel_id` (+ optional `template_id`): `PanelScheduleView.CreateInstanceView`; re-reads the view's panel. Refused when the panel already has one. |

Voltage, poles and distribution-system compatibility are Revit's decisions: the
rehearsal performs the real call, so a refusal returns Revit's message with nothing
committed.

### Resumen (español)

Tres herramientas multi-operación con el mismo rito de escritura: ensayo en una
transacción que se revierte (dry_run por defecto), token de un solo uso, aplicación
dentro de un TransactionGroup y relectura de cada valor pedido tras el commit; si
algo no se verifica, el grupo se revierte. `horizun_manage_styles` lista y edita
estilos de objeto, crea subcategorías, estilos de línea, patrones de línea y de
relleno (no borra: eso es `horizun_delete_verified`). `horizun_manage_units` lee y
cambia el formato de unidades por spec (ForgeTypeId, 2023–2027), lee/escribe
Información de proyecto y lee los puntos base; escribir coordenadas compartidas
exige además `confirm_shared_coordinates=true`, porque mueve el modelo respecto de
vínculos, exportaciones y topografía. `horizun_electrical` lista tableros y
circuitos, crea circuitos, asigna tablero, agrega/quita elementos y crea la tabla
de tablero.



## Curtain grids, railings, slab shape and arrays

All four follow the same discipline: dry run by default, a single-use
`confirmation_token` for the apply, the committed model re-read through a
`PostconditionCheck`, and the whole edit rolled back when it disagrees. Units are
`mm` unless `units` says otherwise.

### `horizun_manage_curtain`

`element_id` is a curtain wall or a curtain system (`grid_index` picks the system's grid).

| operation | arguments | re-read after commit |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | – | u/v lines (ends, `offset` on walls, segments, mullions on each, lock/pin), mullions (type, the grid line they sit on by geometry), panels (type, category, `is_door`, centre), `base_z` |
| `add_grid_line` | `direction` u\|v, `offset` (walls: v = along the location line from its start, u = above the base) **or** `point` | exactly one new line of that direction, at the offset within 0.5 mm (or through the point) |
| `remove_grid_line` | `grid_line_id` | the line is gone and the count fell by one |
| `set_mullions` | `grid_line_id`, `mode` add\|remove, `mullion_type_id` (add), `segment_index` (else every segment) | each targeted segment carries a mullion of that type / none |
| `set_panel_type` | `panel_ids` **or** `point`, `type_id` (panel, curtain-wall door/window, or wall type) | the panel's type, including when Revit replaces the element (new id reported) |

Revit keeps no link between a mullion and its grid line: membership is geometric
(within 1 mm). A segment that already carries a mullion is refused for `add`
(Revit would silently leave it); change its type with `horizun_transform_elements`
`change_type`. Grid lines and panels governed by the wall type's layout may be
refused by Revit; the refusal and the rollback are reported.

### `horizun_slab_shape`

`element_id` is a floor or a roof. `read` lists vertices `[x, y, z, type]`, creases
and the slab top. `add_point` takes `points: [[x, y, offset]]`; `modify_subelement`
takes `points` for existing vertices, or `start`/`end` (`[x, y]`) plus `offset` for
one crease; `add_split_line` takes `start`/`end` and adds a missing interior end
point first; `reset_shape` erases the shape points.

The API changed between years, measured from each year's `RevitAPI.xml`:
2023 has only the `SlabShapeEditor` property and `DrawPoint`/`DrawSplitLine`;
2024 adds `GetSlabShapeEditor()`; 2025 adds `AddPoint`/`AddSplitLine`; 2026–2027
drop the property and the `Draw*` calls. The command compiles the right call per year.
`SlabShapeVertex.Position.Z` is not documented as absolute or relative to the slab
top, so both readings are measured and the one that held is returned in
`evidence.z_convention`.

### `horizun_create_railing`

Either `host_id` (a stair or ramp; `placement` treads\|stringer; Revit creates one
railing per side it decides, all ids are returned and each host is re-read) or `path`
(an open polyline of XYZ points on `level_id`, checked with
`Railing.IsValidPathForRailing`; `GetPath()` is compared segment by segment in plan).
`base_offset` sets `STAIRS_RAILING_HEIGHT_OFFSET`. The height is the type's and is
reported as `type_height`.

### Arrays in `horizun_transform_elements`

`array_linear` (`vector`) and `array_radial` (`axis_start`, `axis_end`,
`angle_degrees`) with `count` (members including the original: linear 2–200,
radial 3–200), `anchor` second\|last and `group` (default false: copies are free
elements; true keeps Revit's associated array, whose id is returned). The array is
created in the active view. Member k of each source is expected at k × step:
anchor=second uses the vector/angle as the step, anchor=last splits it over
count − 1 (a full 360° turn over count). Every copy is matched against that formula
within 1e-5 ft; grouped members are judged by the elements inside their groups.
A radial copy's position is checked, not its axes.

### Resumen (español)

`horizun_manage_curtain` lee y edita rejillas de muro cortina (líneas U/V con
offset medido sobre el muro, montantes por segmento, tipo de panel incluidas
puertas de muro cortina). `horizun_slab_shape` edita la forma de losas y cubiertas
con guardas por año de la API (2023 propiedad + `DrawPoint`; 2025+ `AddPoint`;

## Smaller replies: `response_mode: "summary"` for `horizun_create_elements` and `horizun_clash`

Course dry run 2026-09-30 (defect #17): `horizun_create_elements` of 75 walls answered
262-276 kB and `horizun_clash` with 165 interferences 58 kB, over the client's limit, so
the reply was truncated to a file. Both now take the `response_mode` the reads already
use (`full`, the default, changes nothing). It is presentation only: the measured verdict,
counts, coverage and headline are untouched, and every shortened array is named in
`response_omissions` (`json_pointer`, `returned_items_before_summary`, `shown`,
`omitted`) with `response_detail_complete`, as `horizun_model_scan` does.

- **create_elements** (`rows`, and `api_rehearsal.provisional_verification` of a
  `revit_rollback` rehearsal): a row that did not verify, whose postconditions did not
  all verify, whose source comparison did not match, that carries an error or warnings,
  or whose element the `spatial_check` names stays IN FULL. The rest collapse into
  `rows_summary` - `total`, `by_status` (`verified_clean`, `verified_with_findings`,
  `not_verified`), `by_kind` and `collapsed_element_ids`. Re-read any of them with
  `horizun_query_model element_ids`. Shaped by the dispatcher after the spatial check,
  so the rows it names are known. The confirmation token does not bind
  `response_mode`: a summary rehearsal can be applied in full, and the other way round.
- **clash**: `clash_summary` with totals by category pair and source model
  (`by_pair`), the total intersection volume and the cross-model count, plus the 10
  largest clashes by volume in full, each with its `clash_index` in the full list. The
  rest: `horizun_coordination` (with `record_findings: true`) or the same request with
  `response_mode: "full"` - `expand` names which. Refused with `plan_penetrations`,
  whose plan cites clashes by index.

MEASURED offline on synthetic replies shaped like the real ones
(`ResponseSummaryRulesTests`): 75 clean walls 198,370 -> 1,444 bytes; 165 clashes in the
course run's category mix 51,545 -> 5,041 bytes. Not yet measured on a live reply.

## Clash resolution and batch undo

### horizun_resolve_clash

Detection is common; resolving a clash **with a verification** is the point of this tool.
It works on findings of the ledger that `horizun_clash record_findings=true` maintains
(see `horizun_coordination list`).

**propose** (read-only, default). For each `finding_ids` entry:

1. Roles. Pipes, ducts, conduits, cable trays and flex runs are *movable*. Structure
   (structural framing/columns/foundations, structural walls and floors) and
   architecture are never moved: the row is `report_only` with
   `report_only_no_movable_side`. When both sides are runs, the smaller cross section
   moves; equal sections are `ambiguous_both_movable` (a design decision).
2. Safety and scope. A run in a linked model (`linked_element_not_writable`) or a
   pinned run (`pinned`) is reported, not moved. A run with any connected connector
   is no longer refused outright: its whole connected network (pipes/ducts/conduits/
   cable trays and their fittings/accessories, walked through live connectors, capped
   at 60 elements) is collected and re-checked fresh every time - propose AND apply -
   never trusted from an earlier call. It moves as one rigid body (`mode: "run_shift"`)
   only when EVERY member is a host element, unpinned and outside any group, AND every
   connector at the network's boundary is open (not connected to equipment, fixtures or
   terminals outside the set); otherwise it stays report-only, naming what blocks it:
   `network_exceeds_cap`, `member_in_group`, `boundary_connector_blocked` (with the
   blocking element), or `linked_element_not_writable`/`pinned` for a bad member.
3. Geometry (`Core/ClashResolveRules.cs`). The mover's centreline and exact section are
   compared with the fixed element's bounding box projected on each escape direction:
   `shift` perpendicular to the run in plan, and `elevation` (vertical) for horizontal
   runs only. The run's own axis is never an escape. Distances are whole millimetres,
   rounded away from the clash, and include `clearance_mm` (default 50). Candidates over
   `max_move_mm` (default 600) are rejected.
4. Third elements, HOST AND LINKS. A candidate whose moved box would reach any other
   host model element is rejected (`would_touch_other_elements`, `contacts`); the same
   box, carried into the coordinates of every LOADED Revit link (the link instance's
   total transform, inverted), is checked against that link's elements too
   (`link_contacts`). For a run_shift EVERY member's box is checked, not just the
   mover's - a fitting far from the clash that would land on something is caught too.
   An unloaded link is named in `links_skipped` - it is never silently counted as
   clear. If no candidate survives, the finding is report-only.

Each proposal carries `kind`, `mode` (`single` or `run_shift`), `distance_mm`,
`affected_elements` (every member for a run_shift), a `prediction`, and the ready
`next_arguments` for apply.

**apply**. `dry_run` defaults to true and issues a token bound to the proposals; the
`element_id`/`vector_mm` of each proposal is re-resolved and re-validated fresh against
the LIVE model (pinned/connected/network eligibility all re-derived, never trusted from
propose - a network that changed since propose is refused, not moved on stale
information). Inside one TransactionGroup: the neighbourhood (every host model element
whose box meets the swept region of every MEMBER, grown by the clearance) is measured on
solids BEFORE the move; every member of every move is moved together in one
`ElementTransformUtils.MoveElements` call (a run_shift moves rigidly, never one segment at
a time); positions are re-read (1 mm tolerance); the same neighbourhood is measured AFTER -
AND, in both passes, every member's solid is carried into every loaded link's coordinates
and intersected there too (`ElementIntersectsSolidFilter` + `BooleanOperationsUtils`,
exactly like `SpatialCoherence.AgainstLinks`; the pair key is
`link:<name>:<hostId>~<linkElementId>`, distinct from a host-host pair). For a run_shift,
every internal connector pair recorded at propose time is also re-read
(`connections:<idA>-<idB>`) - a rigid translation should never drop one, and the contract
re-reads rather than assumes. The group is kept only when every position, every internal
connection, the targeted pair, and "no new clash" (host OR link) all measure clean.
Anything else - including a boolean that failed, so the result is unmeasured - rolls the
whole group back and returns `new_clashes` (naming the link when that is what grew back)
and the `postconditions` checklist. Two proposals whose networks share a member are
refused as a batch, before anything moves (moving one would silently disturb the other).
An unloaded link is listed in `links_skipped` on every reply (propose and apply) and never
treated as measured-clear, but it does not by itself block an apply whose host-side pairs
are otherwise clean - the same convention `SpatialCoherence.AgainstLinks` already uses. A
kept apply records an undo batch covering EVERY member (not just the primary mover, so
`horizun_undo` moves the whole network back together) and marks each finding
`resolved_by_model` with the measurement written into its history.

**propose_opening / apply_opening** (sleeves and structural openings). For a clash that
moving cannot fix - an MEP run (pipe, duct, conduit, cable tray, flex run) through a
wall, floor, roof, ceiling, structural framing or column - the run keeps its line and
the HOST gets an opening, or a sleeve. Pure geometry lives in `Core/SleeveRules.cs`.

- **propose_opening** (read-only). Both sides must be host elements (a linked side is
  `linked_element_not_writable`), exactly one an MEP run. The crossing is where the run's
  centreline passes through the host's SOLID (`Solid.IntersectWithCurve`, segments
  inside; entry, exit, `crossing_point_mm` = their midpoint); the host's bounding box is
  only a prefilter, so a rotated wall or a sloped roof gets the real crossing. A run that
  no longer enters the solid (it already passes through an opening) is
  `run_does_not_cross_host`. The size uses the run's OUTER section (`outer_section`): the
  outside diameter (`RBS_PIPE_OUTER_DIAMETER` / conduit outer diameter) when larger than
  the connector's nominal size, plus twice the thickest insulation; a rectangular/oval
  section is squared to its larger side on the connector's axes (unreadable axes: sized
  for every rotation). That section is projected through the host's MEASURED thickness
  along the run, so a skewed crossing is sized `section/cos + thickness*tan`
  (`SleeveRules.FootprintHalfExtent`), then `clearance_mm` (default 50, half per side) is
  added. Routes by host kind: wall -> `wall_opening` (`NewOpening(wall, pt1, pt2)`, always
  rectangular, straight walls only - a curved wall is `curved_wall_not_supported`, a run
  steeper than |z| 0.85 is `run_too_steep_for_wall_opening`); floor/roof/ceiling ->
  `floor_opening` (`NewOpening(host, CurveArray, false)`: a VERTICAL cut, circular for a
  vertical round run; a run flatter than |z| 0.5 is `run_too_flat_for_floor_opening`);
  framing/column -> `sleeve_only` with `cut_refused.code = member_cut_not_offered`. The API
  CAN cut a beam, brace or column (`NewOpening(member, profile, eRefFace)`); this operation
  deliberately does not, because a structural member's penetration is an engineer's sized
  decision - only a sleeve family is placed. A STRUCTURAL wall/floor
  (`WALL_STRUCTURAL_SIGNIFICANT` / `FLOOR_PARAM_IS_STRUCTURAL`) is refused as
  `structural_host_requires_opt_in` unless `allow_structural=true` records that a person
  approved the cut; the same flag is required to place a sleeve on any structural host,
  since a sleeve's void may cut it. Any other host category is `host_kind_not_supported`.
- **apply_opening**. `dry_run` (default) -> `confirmation_token` -> one TransactionGroup.
  Each proposal carries its `crossing_point_mm`, `opening_width_mm`,
  `opening_height_mm` and `shape`, so the token binds the geometry the person saw; apply
  re-derives everything from the live model and refuses a drift beyond 1 mm as
  `geometry_changed_since_propose`. Before writing, the run must still meet the host on
  solids (`nothing_to_cut` otherwise - a second pass over a finding that stays open never
  stacks a second opening). Without `sleeve_type_id` a wall/floor/roof/ceiling is cut; a
  framing/column proposal is refused by name. With `sleeve_type_id` (a family type the
  caller loaded - nothing is compiled in) the family is placed by its own placement type:
  hosted on the host at the crossing; face-based on the host face the run enters (an
  instance host such as a steel beam is walked through `GetSymbolGeometry()` with its
  transform, because instance-geometry references cannot host new elements); level-based
  (`OneLevelBased`, e.g. a generic model) with `NewFamilyInstance(XYZ, symbol, Level, ...)`
  on the run's reference level; line-based along entry->exit; anything else at the
  crossing point. Point placements are rotated about Z to a horizontal run.
  `approval_parameter` + `approval_value` write a text mark (e.g. `pending structural
  approval`) on the created element; a missing, read-only or non-text parameter rolls
  everything back.
- **Postconditions**, re-read inside the group before it is kept: `created:<finding>`;
  `clearance:<finding>` - a clearance envelope (the run's outer section grown by
  `clearance_mm/2`, less 0.5 mm tolerance, from before the entry to past the exit) is
  intersected with the cut host's solid and the sleeve's own solid and must meet no
  material; nothing measurable (an uncut, void-only sleeve) is unreadable and rolls back;
  `host_cleared:<finding>` (openings) - a solid re-detection must find the run no longer
  meeting the host; `host_cut:<finding>` (sleeves) - MEASURED the same way, never assumed,
  so a hosted sleeve whose void cuts on hosting reports `host_cut: true`;
  `level:<finding>` and `at_crossing:<finding>` for a level-based or point-placed sleeve;
  `approval:<finding>`; and `no_new_clash` around the crossing (the sleeve inside its own
  host is the design, not a new clash; the sleeve against the run, a third element or a
  loaded link is; an unreadable sleeve geometry makes detection incomplete). Any failure
  rolls the whole group back and reports the rollback status read from Revit. A kept
  apply records an undo batch (`created`) for `horizun_undo`, and the finding gets an
  `opening_requested` history entry (with the measured host_cut) but STAYS OPEN: only a
  later `horizun_clash record_findings=true` measurement can resolve it.
- To measure live: the orientation of a point-placed sleeve depends on how its family
  was modelled (caught by the clearance envelope, not predicted); whether a rectangular
  duct connector's `CoordinateSystem` BasisX/BasisY are its section axes (the opening is
  squared to the larger side either way); face-based placement on a sloped or curved host
  face is not built (it fails with the reason).
- Live probe: `scripts/live-probes/sleeves-openings.probes.ps1` (offline test
  `sleeves-openings.tests.ps1`) stages an own level with a pipe through a wall, a vertical
  pipe through a floor and a vertical pipe through a beam; it applies the wall and floor
  cuts (with `allow_structural=true` as the fixture's recorded approval), reads the finding
  back as still `open` with its `opening_requested` entry, checks the beam refusal by name
  in propose and in the apply rehearsal, deletes everything and closes the probe's own
  findings (`closed_by_decision`). The sleeve family path is not staged (no sleeve family
  ships with the fixtures).

### horizun_undo

Revit exposes no Undo through its API. After a verified commit,
`horizun_transform_elements` (move, copy, rotate, mirror, pin/unpin, change_type,
set_curve on a line, move_tag_head), `horizun_write_params_verified`,
`horizun_create_elements` and `horizun_resolve_clash` record an inverse in
`<data root>/undo/<document hash>.json` (last 20 batches) and report it as an `undo`
block. Operations without an inverse (set_tag_leader, wall_join, a non-line set_curve,
a parameter whose previous value was unreadable) record the batch as **not undoable** by
name, so `undo_last` never skips past it to an older batch.

- `list` - the document's batches, newest first, and whether `undo_last` is available.
- `undo_last` - dry run first. Refused when the document was saved or synchronized since
  the batch (its VersionGUID/NumberOfSaves stamp moved), or when any element the batch
  touched no longer carries the state the batch left (location, type, pin, orientation,
  tag head, or the parameter value). Otherwise every inverse runs in one transaction in
  reverse order (created -> deleted, parameters -> previous values, moves -> the opposite
  vector, rotations -> the opposite angle, mirrors -> the same plane); a delete that would
  take elements the batch did not create rolls back; every element is re-read against
  the state the batch found, in a `PostconditionCheck`.

### Resumen (español)

`horizun_resolve_clash propose` convierte hallazgos abiertos del ledger en correcciones
candidatas conservadoras: solo mueve tramos MEP del modelo anfitrión, sin conexiones ni
pin, el mínimo más la holgura (desplazamiento perpendicular o cambio de elevación);
estructura, arquitectura, vínculos, tramos conectados o movimientos que tocarían a un
tercero quedan como "solo informar". `apply` mueve dentro de un TransactionGroup y
vuelve a detectar sobre sólidos: el par debe desaparecer sin clashes nuevos o se revierte
todo; solo entonces el hallazgo pasa a `resolved_by_model`. `horizun_undo` deshace el
último lote Horizun registrado, y se niega si el documento se guardó o sincronizó desde
entonces o si esos elementos cambiaron.

### Handoff from naviscoord-mcp (Navisworks coordination)

naviscoord-mcp's `navis_handoff` writes `coordination_handoff.json` (schema
`naviscoord.coordination/1`) and `revit_worklist.json` (schema
`naviscoord.coordination.worklist/1`) after a Navisworks clash analysis. The Revit
side of that handoff is two `horizun_coordination` operations plus the existing
`horizun_resolve_clash`/`horizun_verify_changes` - no new tool, because the ledger
they read and write is the same one `horizun_clash record_findings=true` already
maintains:

```
navis_handoff (Navisworks)
   -> coordination_handoff.json
   -> horizun_coordination operation=import_navisworks   (RE-DETECTS, then records)
   -> horizun_resolve_clash propose / apply               (moves the responsible side)
      -or- horizun_coordination operation=show             (paints the pair in a persistent view)
   -> horizun_verify_changes                               (picture + spatial check of the result)
   -> re-run the clash test in Navisworks
```

**`operation=import_navisworks`** never takes Navisworks' word for a clash. Every
issue's `targets` (each an `{side, revit_element_id, source_file, discipline, ...}`)
are matched against the ACTIVE document and every LOADED rvt link by `source_file`,
normalized (extension and NWC/export/copy decoration stripped, case-insensitive -
`Core/NavisworksHandoff.cs`), then the pair is **RE-DETECTED here**: a solid
intersection (volume reported), or a measured bounding-box gap when it does not
reproduce. Only a REPRODUCED pair becomes or refreshes a ledger finding, tagged
`external_source=navisworks` with the issue's `priority`, `responsible`,
`immovable_side` (resolved to the ledger's A/B letter from the issue's own
`side_a_discipline`/`side_b_discipline`) and `suggested_action` carried along - and
`runComplete` is always false, so an import never marks anything `resolved_by_model`
by itself; that stays a measured, complete `horizun_clash` run's job, exactly as
`CoordinationRules.Merge` already enforces for every other source. `revit_worklist.json`
keeps only the responsible side per issue (naviscoord's own filter), so it carries no
fixed-side element to pair against; imported anyway, every one of its issues reports
`not_traceable` naming that reason rather than inventing a one-sided finding. Reports
`issues_total`/`traceable`/`matched`/`reproduced`/`not_reproduced`/`not_traceable`
(the last covering both "no Element Id" and "Element Id resolves in no loaded
document"), dry run by default.

**`horizun_resolve_clash`** needs no change to accept these findings: `propose` reads
the imported `immovable_side` off the finding and enforces it ON TOP of its own
natural choice (`Core/ClashResolveRules.EnforceImmovableSide`) - unchanged when the
natural mover already respects it, inverted to the other side when that side is
itself a movable host run, and refused (`immovable_side_blocks_resolution`) when the
marked-immovable side is the only one that could move. `apply` re-detects on solids
exactly as it does for a `horizun_clash`-detected finding.

**`operation=show`** creates a PERSISTENT 3D view (section box around the selected
findings; the side that must move painted red, the immovable side orange, an unknown
preference blue) so a coordinator can see what a proposal is about to move without
leaving Revit. This is the one `horizun_coordination` operation that writes the
model - `dry_run` -> token -> apply, verified by re-reading the view, its section box
and a bounded sample of the overrides - the ledger file itself stays untouched by it.
A finding side that lives in a link is painted at the LINK INSTANCE level (Revit has
no per-element override across a link boundary) and `link_level_overrides` says so.

**Measured end to end on 2026-09-26** (Navisworks Manage 2026 + Revit 2026, one pipe
Ø150 through one 457x475 column): Navisworks found the clash (112 mm penetration),
`navis_handoff` named Revit ids 1352627/1352136, `import_navisworks` reproduced it
here (8.66 L shared), `show` painted it, `resolve_clash` moved the pipe 363 mm with the
column kept immovable, re-detection on solids cleared the pair with no new clash, and
the SAME Navisworks test re-run against the saved `.rvt` (through the `.nwf` that keeps
the sets and tests) reported the result Resolved - 0 active issues. Two traps it cost:

- **Detail level decides what Navisworks sees.** Navisworks reads a `.rvt` through its
  3D view; at Coarse a pipe is a single LINE (1 primitive) and a Hard test between
  solids reports **zero** clashes against it. The same pipe at Fine was 1587 triangles
  and clashed. Before a model goes to Navisworks, its 3D view (`{3D}`, or the one named
  `Navisworks`) must be Fine - otherwise "0 clashes" means "MEP was never tested".
- **A view camera is not an obstacle.** Revit files every 3D view's camera under the
  MODEL category `OST_Cameras`, with a bounding box the size of the view. The resolver
  counted three of them as elements a move "would touch" and refused every lateral
  shift; cameras, viewers, section boxes and MEP system elements are now outside what
  both the spatial check and the resolver treat as physical.
- **Navisworks reads a view named with "Navisworks" before `{3D}`.** With `{3D}` at
  Fine and a 3D view called "HZ Navisworks b3b1d996" at Medium, both pipes arrived as
  lines again and the Hard test found nothing. Renaming only that view brought them
  back as solids (1587 and 1787 triangles). `show` named its own view
  "Horizun - Navisworks <date>" by default, so the product planted the view that
  spoiled the next export. Now:
  - `show` defaults to "Horizun - Coordination <date>" and refuses any `view_name`
    containing "Navisworks";
  - `navisworks_readiness` judges every 3D view whose name contains "Navisworks"
    (listed in `candidate_views`);
  - `prepare_navisworks` sets every one of those views to Fine.

**The loop, closed without re-running Navisworks (measured the same day).** Second
round on the same model:
1. `navisworks_readiness` caught the Medium view (`not_ready`, naming it).
2. `prepare_navisworks` set it to Fine and re-read it.
3. A new pipe through the column was detected in Navisworks (76 mm), handed off,
   imported (reproduced), shown in "Horizun - Coordination <date>", and moved 338 mm
   by `resolve_clash`.
4. `navisworks_status` suggested `resolved` for it.
5. `navis_set_status` applied that suggestion in Navisworks, verified by re-reading
   the document. The analysis then held zero active issues.

The status travels from Revit's measured verdict back to the coordination model;
nobody types it.

#### Resumen (español)

`navis_handoff` de naviscoord-mcp escribe `coordination_handoff.json`;
`horizun_coordination operation=import_navisworks` empareja cada elemento por
`source_file` normalizado contra el documento activo y los vínculos cargados, y
**vuelve a medir el choque aquí mismo** (intersección de sólidos, o la distancia
medida si no se reproduce) antes de tocar el ledger - solo un par REPRODUCIDO entra
o se refresca como hallazgo, con origen `navisworks` y `runComplete=false` siempre,
así que nunca resuelve un hallazgo por sí solo. `horizun_resolve_clash` no cambió:
ya respeta el `immovable_side` importado (invierte el lado que mueve o se niega si
el lado inmóvil es el único que podría moverse) sobre su propia elección natural.
`horizun_coordination operation=show` crea una vista 3D persistente con el lado que
debe moverse en rojo y el inmóvil en naranja, para mirar antes de aplicar; es la
única operación de `horizun_coordination` que escribe el modelo, con el mismo
dry_run -> token -> apply -> verificación releída del resto del producto.

Probado de punta a punta el 2026-09-26 (Navisworks 2026 + Revit 2026): choque
detectado en Navisworks, reproducido en Revit, tubería movida 363 mm con la columna
inmóvil, y el mismo test de Navisworks lo marcó Resuelto al re-correrlo. Ojo: la vista
3D que Navisworks lee debe estar en detalle **Fino**; en Grueso la tubería llega como
una línea y el test Hard reporta cero choques contra ella.

### BCF import from any tool, and Navisworks readiness

`horizun_coordination operation=import` used to stop at "unmatched" for any topic
that was not this ledger's own export (matched by the guid `BcfTopicGuid` mints for
each finding). A `.bcfzip` a coordinator actually gets back - from Navisworks, ACC,
Solibri, BIMcollab - names its clash by the topic's viewpoint **Components**
(`IfcGuid` and/or `AuthoringToolId`), never by that internal guid. Those topics are
now resolved and re-detected exactly like `operation=import_navisworks` does beside
it, instead of merely being reported:

```
somebody's coordination tool
   -> a .bcfzip (BCF 2.1 or 3.0 - both viewpoint shapes are read, Core/BcfMarkupReader.cs)
   -> horizun_coordination operation=import
        - topic matches THIS ledger's own guid  -> status/comments only (unchanged)
        - topic from ANY OTHER tool             -> resolve Components, RE-DETECT, fold in
   -> only a REPRODUCED pair becomes a finding (origin `bcf`, runComplete=false always)
```

**Resolving a Component**, in `Core/CoordinationImportBcfExternal.cs`, two
independent paths tried in this order:

- **`AuthoringToolId`** - tried as a Revit Element Id (an integer), then as a Revit
  UniqueId (`Document.GetElement(string)`), against the active document and every
  LOADED link.
- **`IfcGuid`** - the compressed 22-character IFC GlobalId. First the `IFC_GUID`
  parameter (a native `ElementParameterFilter`, so this never walks the model to find
  it); when nothing was ever stored there, Revit's own **computed** default -
  `ExportUtils.GetExportId(doc, id)` - is what a fresh export actually writes, so the
  incoming compressed guid is decoded back to that same .NET `Guid` (`Core/IfcGuidCodec.cs`,
  a Revit-free port of the buildingSMART IFC2x3 compression algorithm) and matched
  against an index built once per document per import, capped defensively - a model
  too large to scan in one call falls back to the parameter path alone rather than
  hanging.

A topic resolving fewer than two DISTINCT elements is reported `external_not_traceable`
with the reason, never invented; one that resolves two but does not reproduce lands in
`external_not_reproduced`. A reproduced pair's row in `external_reproduced` carries the
topic's `topic_guid`/`title`/`priority`/`assigned_to`/`status`, and its status/AssignedTo/
comments are folded onto the (possibly brand-new) finding through the SAME
conflict-aware logic a matched topic already uses.

**`operation=navisworks_readiness`** (read-only) finds the 3D view Navisworks' own
Revit exporter reads - one named exactly `Navisworks`, else the default `{3D}` - and
reports its detail level, section box, visual phase, and every MODEL category **with
elements in the model** that is hidden in it. Verdict `not_ready` when detail level is
not Fine (see the measured Coarse-vs-Fine trap two sections up - it is the same one)
or when an MEP category with elements is hidden (it will never reach Navisworks at
all, regardless of detail level). **`operation=prepare_navisworks`** is the fix -
`dry_run` -> token -> apply - setting that view's detail level to Fine and, only with
`unhide=true`, unhiding the named categories; `View.CanCategoryBeHidden` is checked
BEFORE ever opening a transaction (a view template governing category visibility, or
a dependent view, refuses there), and `DetailLevel`/`GetCategoryHidden` are re-read
after commit to decide success - never the calls not throwing.

**`operation=navisworks_status`** (read-only) reports, for every ledger finding with
`external_source=navisworks`, its own `revit_status` and `resolved_by_model_at` plus
a `navis_set_status` suggestion list (`resolved` only when a complete detection run
measured the pair gone, `active` otherwise - including a human `closed_by_decision`
or `accepted_risk`, which is a decision, not a measurement) ready to feed to
naviscoord-mcp's `navis_set_status`; `path`+`overwrite` optionally write it to a JSON
file, re-read and row-count verified. It writes nothing to Navisworks itself.

#### Resumen (español)

`operation=import` ya no se detiene en "unmatched" para un topic que no es de este
ledger: cada Component de su viewpoint (`IfcGuid`/`AuthoringToolId`) se resuelve
contra el documento activo y los vínculos cargados - por Element Id o UniqueId, o por
el parámetro `IFC_GUID` y, si no está guardado, por el id de exportación calculado de
Revit decodificado del mismo guid comprimido (`Core/IfcGuidCodec.cs`) - y el par se
**vuelve a medir** exactamente como `import_navisworks`. Solo un par reproducido entra
como hallazgo (origen `bcf`, `runComplete=false` siempre); uno que resuelve menos de
dos elementos se reporta `external_not_traceable` con la razón, nunca se inventa.

`navisworks_readiness` (solo lectura) busca la vista 3D `Navisworks` o `{3D}` y
reporta su nivel de detalle, caja de sección, fase visual y qué categorías MEP con
elementos están ocultas - `not_ready` si el detalle no es Fino o si hay una categoría
MEP oculta. `prepare_navisworks` (escritura, dry_run -> token -> apply) pone el
detalle en Fino y, solo con `unhide=true`, desoculta las categorías nombradas,
verificado por relectura tras el commit. `navisworks_status` (solo lectura) reporta
el estado propio de cada hallazgo de origen `navisworks` y sugiere qué mandarle a
naviscoord-mcp - nunca escribe en Navisworks.

## Parameters and classification

### `horizun_manage_parameters`

| operation | writes | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_bindings` | no | Every entry of the BindingMap: name, parameter element id, data type (SpecTypeId), Instance/Type, categories, group, shared + GUID, VariesAcrossGroups. |
| `create_shared` | model + SPF | Reuses or creates the definition `name` in group `spf_group` of `spf_path` (file created if missing), then binds it to `categories` as `binding_kind` in `group` (default `PG_DATA`). Instance bindings get `SetAllowVaryBetweenGroups(true)` unless `allow_vary_between_groups=false`. |
| `create_project` | no | Refused by name: RevitAPI 2023-2027 has no call that creates a non-shared project parameter (`SharedParameterElement.Create` is the only factory; measured by reflection over all five years). No Python fallback is offered, because a script meets the same absent API. |
| `rebind` | model | Changes the category set (`categories` is the FINAL set), Instance/Type and/or group of an existing binding, found by `guid` or a unique `name`. |
| `remove_binding` | model | Removes the binding; the parameter element stays in the document. |
| `global_list` | no | Every Global Parameter: value (internal, display, formatted), formula, reporting, affected elements. |
| `global_create` / `global_set` / `global_delete` | model | `value` in the project's display units for measurable specs; `formula`; `associate: [{element_id, parameter}]`. `value` and `formula` are exclusive; a value on a formula-driven global is refused. |

**Data types.** 2023+ has no `ParameterType`. `data_type` accepts a SpecTypeId id
(`autodesk.spec.aec:length-2.0.0`, version optional), a SpecTypeId path (`String.Text`,
`Boolean.YesNo`, `Length`) or a legacy ParameterType name (`Text`, `YesNo`, `Integer`,
`Number`, `Length`, `Area`, `Volume`, `Angle`, `URL`, `Material`...), mapped in
`Core/ParameterClassificationRules.cs`.

**Rehearsal and verification.** `dry_run` defaults to true: the write runs in a
transaction that is rolled back and the reply carries the postcondition checklist and a
single-use `confirmation_token`. For `create_shared` the rehearsal runs against a
temporary COPY of the SPF, so the caller's file is never touched by a dry run. Apply
re-runs the same plan, checks it before the commit and re-reads it after:
binding kind, categories, group, data type, VariesAcrossGroups, and for `create_shared`
the SPF FILE parsed from disk (GUID, name, group). `rebind` / `remove_binding` count the
elements (instances or types) that hold a value in the categories being dropped; that
count is part of the plan the token binds (`ExpectedCascadeCount`), so a model that
gained values since the dry run is refused as a stale plan.

**Residual gaps.** The SPF definition is written before the transaction; a binding that
then fails leaves the definition in the file (`spf_definition_created` says so).
`global_set` checks each association, not that the element parameter already shows the
global's value.

### `horizun_query_classification` (read only)

| operation | returns |
|---|---|
| `keynote_table` / `assembly_code` | `source` (element id, path, server id, version status, file exists, link status), every entry (code, parent, text, level) with `types` and `instances` carrying that code, `codes_in_use`. |
| `unused_codes` | Codes of `table` that no type carries. |
| `missing_codes` | Placed types (one or more instances) without a code, and types (or materials, for keynotes) whose code is not in the table. |
| `family_lookup_tables` | Per family (all, or `family_id`): size table names, columns (name, spec) and row count. |

Codes are read from `KEYNOTE_PARAM` (types and materials) and from the assembly code
parameter of types (`UNIFORMAT_CODE` up to 2025, `ASSEMBLY_CODE` from 2026 - renamed in
the API, guarded per year). An empty or unloaded table is reported with a `warning`,
because it makes every code read as absent. Lookup tables are read with
`FamilySizeTableManager.GetFamilySizeTableManager(projectDocument, familyId)`: the
family is not opened, edited or reloaded.

### Live probes

`scripts/live-probes/parameters.probes.ps1` (offline test: `parameters.tests.ps1`):
list_bindings; create_project refused; create_shared of `HZ_PROBE_<run>` (Text, Walls,
Instance) into a temporary SPF under ScratchRoot, verified in the model and in the file,
then removed with remove_binding; a Length global created at 1500, read back, set to
2500 and deleted; keynote_table and family_lookup_tables read.

---

**Resumen en español.** `horizun_manage_parameters` lista el BindingMap completo, crea
parámetros compartidos en un SPF (el ensayo usa una copia temporal del SPF) y los
bindea, cambia o retira bindings contando los valores que se perderían, y gestiona
Global Parameters (valor en unidades de visualización, fórmula, asociación a parámetros
de elementos, borrado) releyendo el valor calculado. `create_project` se rechaza con
nombre: ninguna API de Revit 2023-2027 crea parámetros de proyecto no compartidos.
`horizun_query_classification` es solo lectura: tablas de keynote y Assembly Code (ruta,
estado, entradas, padre, uso por código), códigos sin uso, tipos sin código o con
códigos que no existen en la tabla, y tablas de búsqueda de familias leídas desde el
proyecto sin abrir la familia.



## Model diff, explanation and quality history

`horizun_model_diff` answers the question a contractor asks of every new
delivery - *what changed?* - without a coordination model or a linked copy.

### Operations

| operation | reads | writes |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | active document, or `file_path` + `expected_version` opened in the background (detached when workshared) and closed without saving | `%USERPROFILE%\.horizun\snapshots\<id>.json.gz` + `<id>.meta.json` |
| `list` | the meta files | nothing |
| `compare` | two sides: a snapshot id or `active` | `snapshots\exports\<comparison>.csv` and `.json` |
| `colorize` | `before` snapshot vs the active model | a NEW view duplicated from `view_id` with overrides (the only model write) |
| `explain` | the active model, the project's quality history, `project_context_path` | nothing |
| `record_quality` | runs `horizun_model_scan` (summary) or `horizun_audit_model` in process | one line appended to `quality-history\<project>.jsonl` |
| `quality_trend` | the JSONL | `quality-history\<project>.trend.csv` |

### What a snapshot holds

Model elements only (model categories, not types, not view-specific): UniqueId,
element id, BuiltInCategory and category name, family and type (and the type's
UniqueId), level, workset, created/demolished phase, bounding box and location
(point or curve end points) in internal feet, every instance parameter and -
once per type - every type parameter, normalised (`d:` doubles rounded to 1e-9
in internal units, `i:` integers, `s:` strings trimmed to 256 characters, `e:`
element ids, `n:` no value), and a hash of volume, area and bounding-box extent.
`EDITED_BY` is skipped: who borrowed an element last is not a model change.
`max_elements` (default 50,000, cap 500,000) and `categories` bound it; a
truncated snapshot says so and so does every comparison using it. The document
facts carry the title, path, Revit version, saved format, VersionGUID and number
of saves when Revit exposes them.

### How a comparison decides

- **Identity is the UniqueId.** An element in both sides is compared; otherwise
  it is added or deleted.
- **Modified** means any of: type (family/type/type UniqueId), level, workset,
  phases, a move above `move_tolerance_mm` (default 1 mm; location first, else
  bounding-box centre, reported as `moved_mm`), geometry hash, or an instance
  parameter whose value differs (numbers within 1e-6 internal units are equal).
  Each change carries `before` and `after`.
- **Type parameters** are reported once per type in `type_changes`, not on each
  instance.
- **Re-created models.** When the smaller side shares under 50 % of its
  UniqueIds (and holds at least 10 elements), `summary.identity_warning` says so.
  `heuristic_match=true` then pairs deleted and added elements with the same
  category, family and type whose anchor points lie within 50 mm, nearest first,
  each used once; every such row has `inferred=true` and `before_unique_id`.
- **Discipline** is inferred from the BuiltInCategory (structure, mechanical,
  plumbing, electrical, site, architecture) - Revit declares none per element.
- `detail` is paged (`offset`, `limit` up to 1,000); the exports hold every row.
  CSV cells that start with `= + - @` (and are not numbers) are prefixed with `'`.

### colorize

`dry_run` (default) resolves the comparison and issues a token bound to the
document, `before`, `view_id` and the exact set of element UniqueIds to colour.
The apply duplicates the view (no detailing), removes its template, names it
`Horizun diff <snapshot>`, overrides added elements green (0,170,0) and modified
orange (255,140,0) - projection line colour plus a solid surface pattern when the
model has one - re-reads every override before committing (rolls back on any
mismatch) and again after. Elements not visible in the view are counted in
`not_in_view`; deleted elements cannot be coloured and are counted too.

### Quality history

`record_quality` stores what the scan or audit itself reported: for
`model_scan`, every bucket `total` of every section with `status: ok` as
`section.bucket`, plus `document.*_count` and `file_size_mb`; a failed section
contributes nothing and is listed in `failed`. For `audit_model`, each finding's
`count` and `is_issue`, and `health.score` when a health profile produced one.
`complete=false` marks a run that did not see the whole model. Malformed lines in
the JSONL are counted in `malformed_lines`, never skipped silently. `quality_trend`
returns one wide row per run (filter with `metrics`, `*` suffix allowed), ready
to pass as `rows` to `horizun_power_bi_push`.

### Limits

- A background open refuses when the file's version differs from the host
  (no upgrade), and cloud models are not opened by `snapshot`.
- The geometry hash is cheap by design: a reshaped element with the same volume,
  area and extent is not detected as a geometry change.
- `colorize` re-reads the projection line colour of each override; the surface
  pattern is set but not compared.

### Resumen (español)

`horizun_model_diff` responde "¿qué cambió entre estas dos entregas?". `snapshot`
guarda una instantánea del modelo activo o de un `.rvt` abierto en segundo plano
(desvinculado si es colaborativo) y cerrado sin guardar; `compare` reporta
añadidos, borrados y modificados (parámetros antes/después, movimientos sobre la
tolerancia, cambios de tipo) por categoría, disciplina inferida y nivel, con
paginación y exportación CSV/JSON. La identidad es el UniqueId; si el modelo fue
re-creado se avisa y `heuristic_match` empareja por categoría/tipo/ubicación,
marcando cada par como `inferred`. `colorize` es la única escritura: duplica una
vista y colorea con dry_run, token y relectura. `explain` resume solo hechos
medidos y, con `project_context_path`, lo que falta para ISO 19650 según el mismo
validador de `horizun_project_context`. `record_quality` y `quality_trend` llevan
el historial de calidad en JSONL y lo entregan listo para Power BI.



## Impact preview (MCP Apps)

**What it is.** An MCP App served at `ui://horizun/impact-preview`
(`text/html;profile=mcp-app`, MCP Apps extension, spec 2026-01-26). A host that
supports MCP Apps shows it beside the reply of a bulk write's **rehearsal**
(`dry_run=true`, the default) so a person can see what the write will touch before
approving it, and take some elements out.

**Which tools declare it.** Only the five whose rehearsal payload it knows how to read,
through `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in `tools/list`:

| Tool | Rows shown | What "exclude" removes from the request |
|---|---|---|
| `horizun_write_params_verified` | one per write (`rows[].index`), before -> requested | that entry of `writes[]` |
| `horizun_set_keynote` | one per resolved target (type or instance), current -> new keynote | every id in `element_ids` that resolved to that target |
| `horizun_delete_verified` | one per requested id and per cascade (`change_preview`) | `mode=ids`: the id from `ids`; `mode=purge_unused`: the id is added to `protect_ids`. A cascade row cannot be excluded alone: exclude the id that causes it |
| `horizun_transform_elements` | one per element (`change_preview`), operation / type / pin before -> after | the id from each operation's `element_ids`; an operation left empty is dropped |
| `horizun_create_elements` | one per planned element (`create:<index>`), kind, type, level | that entry of `elements[]` |

A rehearsal expanded from a CSV (`tabular_source`) is shown but cannot be narrowed row by
row: the rows are generated from the file on every call.

**What it shows.** How many elements the resolved plan holds (`plan_resolved.elements`),
counts by category and by level, a table of the rows with before -> after where the reply
has both, and warnings: elements you did not name that change too (shared type,
cascade), a blast radius that is a lower bound, unresolved entries, a withheld token,
and "only N of M rows are shown - the rest WILL be applied" when `change_preview` was
truncated (it carries at most 50 rows; exclusion is only possible for shown rows).

**The contract it keeps.** A `confirmation_token` approves ONE request: all five commands
fold the field the app narrows into their plan hash (`ImpactPreviewAppTests` asserts it
against the command sources). So the app never spends an old token on fewer elements:

1. With rows excluded, **Rehearse without N excluded** calls the same tool again with
   `dry_run=true`, the reduced request, and no token or idempotency key. The new
   rehearsal replaces the old one on screen, with a check that the excluded rows left
   the plan and that it did not grow.
2. With nothing excluded, **Apply** calls the tool with the arguments of the rehearsal on
   screen, `dry_run=false`, that rehearsal's own `confirmation_token` and a fresh
   `idempotency_key` (kept for a retry of the same token, so a retry replays instead of
   writing twice). The reply's `application.state` is shown; the button is then spent.

The app only calls tools when the host grants it (`hostCapabilities.serverTools`) and it
knows the original arguments (`ui/notifications/tool-input`); otherwise it is a read-only
view and the apply goes through the chat as always. After a re-rehearsal or an apply it
tells the model what happened through `ui/update-model-context`. The command's own gate
still decides: a stale plan, an expired token or a different document is refused by the
bridge exactly as for any other client.

**What it does not do.** It fetches nothing and loads nothing: no URL, no CDN, empty CSP
(`connectDomains`, `resourceDomains`, `frameDomains`, `baseUriDomains`). It renders only
what the rehearsal said. No view thumbnail: `horizun_capture_view` holds Revit's UI thread
and would be a tool call the user did not ask for. A host without MCP Apps sees exactly
the reply it saw before.

**Hosts.** The MCP Apps project lists ChatGPT, Claude, VS Code, Goose, Postman, MCPJam,
mcp-use and Alpic Playground as supporting hosts
([ext-apps README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps), read 2026-09-24).
Not measured here in any of them; the flow was exercised against a scripted host that

**Tests.** `tests/Horizun.Server.Tests/ImpactPreviewAppTests.cs` (resource, mime type,
CSP, declaring tools, tools/list cost, no network, plan-hash coverage, field names tied to
the emitting source) and `ImpactPreview/adapter.test.js`, the pure adapter under node
against five synthetic fixtures (no live capture of these rehearsals existed when it was
written). `scripts/live-probes/impact-preview.probes.ps1` measures the real replies in
Revit, including that a full-plan token is refused for a narrowed request.

### Resumen (español)

`ui://horizun/impact-preview` es una MCP App que muestra el **ensayo** (dry_run) de las
cinco escrituras masivas - `write_params_verified`, `set_keynote`, `delete_verified`,
`transform_elements`, `create_elements`: total por categoría y nivel, antes -> después por
fila, advertencias (colaterales, cascada, vista truncada, token retenido) y una casilla
por fila para **excluirla**. El token ata la petición completa (el campo que se reduce
entra en el hash del plan de cada comando), así que excluir filas pide un **nuevo
ensayo** de la petición reducida, y **Aplicar** solo gasta el token del ensayo que está en
pantalla, con una idempotency_key nueva. HTML autocontenido sin URLs ni CSP abierta, modo
claro/oscuro, tabla accesible. Sin herramientas nuevas: tools/list crece 305 bytes.

## Code checks, 4D and federation

### `horizun_code_check` — a requirement set with geometry

Runs the grammar of [requirement-set.md](requirement-set.md) over the active
model. That grammar had a loader (`Core/RequirementSet.cs`) and no tool; this is
the tool, and it runs `docs/requirement-sets/*.json` unchanged. It is separate from
`horizun_audit_model` (whose `requirement_set` gates the audit's aggregate counts)
and from `horizun_audit_access` (a flat threshold map without per-rule selectors,
citations or `not_decidable`).

Additions to the grammar, all optional:

| Key | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `measure` | assertion | A geometric quantity the bridge computes, instead of `parameter` (exactly one of the two). |
| `between` | operator | `value: [min, max]`, inclusive. |
| `unit` | assertion | `mm`, `m`, `m2`, `lx`: a numeric parameter is converted to it first; a parameter whose spec does not accept the unit reads as blank. |
| `missing_is` | assertion | `fails` (default) or `not_decidable` for an absent or blank value. |
| `name_matches`, `parameter_equals`, `measure_range` | selector | Element name regex; `{parameter, value}`; `{measure, min?, max?}` selects elements whose measure lies in `(min, max]`. |
| `source` | rule | Norm and numeral, echoed on every rule row. |
| `unverified_value` | rule | The threshold was not verified against the norm's text: the value may be omitted and every element is `not_decidable`. |
| `config` | rule | Configuration of `exit_count_minus_required`. |

Unknown keys in a rule, selector or assertion are refused, like unknown top-level keys.

Measures (`Core/CodeCheckRules.cs`):

| Measure | Source | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| `door_clear_width_mm` | door Width (instance, then type) | UPPER bound: below a minimum it fails for certain, above it is `not_decidable`. |
| `ramp_slope_percent`, `ramp_run_length_mm`, `ramp_width_mm`, `ramp_landing_length_mm` | the ramp's own planar top faces | exact geometry; a ramp with no flat top face has no landing measure. |
| `stair_riser_mm`, `stair_tread_mm`, `stair_2r_plus_t_mm`, `stair_run_width_mm` | `Stairs.ActualRiserHeight/ActualTreadDepth`, narrowest `StairsRun.ActualRunWidth` | exact; handrails not deducted. |
| `space_illuminance_lx` | Space `Average Estimated Illumination` | 0 or empty is `not_decidable` (Revit computed nothing). |
| `exit_count_minus_required` | per Level: placed rooms, doors | needs `config`: an occupant load (`occupant_load_parameter`, or `occupancy_parameter` + `area_per_person_by_group: {group: m2}` so each room takes the factor of the group it declares, or one `area_per_person_m2`), `exit_door` (`{parameter, value}` or `{mark_prefix}`) and `required_exits: [{max_load, exits}]`; any missing piece - including a room with no group or a group the table does not list - is `not_decidable`. |
| `travel_distance_m` | per room, routed with Revit's path of travel | only when the rule's OWN `config` names `route_view_id(s)` (a floor plan, crop off) and `exits`; a rule without one stays `not_decidable` and never borrows another rule's routes. The value is a LOWER bound: above the limit it `fails`; it `passes` only under a proven ceiling (see below); otherwise `not_decidable`. Multi-level egress is `not_decidable` with a reason prefixed `not_assessable:`. |

Outcomes are `passes`, `fails`, `not_decidable`, `unreadable`. A rule's verdict is
`fails` if any element fails, `not_decidable` if any element is undecided or the
rule examined nothing, `passes` otherwise. Parameters may be named by display name
or by `BuiltInParameter` token (`ALL_MODEL_MARK`), which does not change with the
language of Revit. Categories accept `OST_*` tokens or display names.

  Space names; plus a Room template with a declared illuminance parameter.


#### Egress travel distance — `operation: "travel_distance"`

Routes egress per room with Revit's own `PathOfTravel` service (same members in 2023–2027).

```json
{ "operation": "travel_distance",
  "travel": { "view_ids": [123], "exits": { "parameter": "Comments", "value": "EXIT" },
              "room_ids": [456], "max_m": 45, "create_paths": false } }
```

- `exits` is the caller's declaration — `{parameter, value?}`, `{mark_prefix}` or `{element_ids}`. Nothing in a
  model reliably marks an exit, so it is never guessed.
- Per room: the longest of the routed sample points (boundary corners pulled 300 mm toward the room point and kept
  only if Revit's own room lookup still puts them in that room, the room point, and any whole-plan start from
  `FindStartsOfLongestPathsFromRooms` that falls in the room) to the nearest declared exit (`FindShortestPaths`; the
  exit reached comes from `FindEndsOfShortestPaths`). Each row gives `distance_m`, `bound: "lower"`,
  `upper_bound_m`, `candidates`, `routed`, `dropped_outside_room`, `exit_door_id`, `start_m`, `polyline_m` and
  `outcome` (`passes|fails|measured|not_decidable|not_assessable`).
- **`distance_m` is a lower bound.** The true farthest point is at least that far. Over `max_m` is a certain
  `fails`. A `passes` needs `upper_bound_m <= max_m`, and a ceiling is proven only for a convex room of straight
  walls, no island, and every sample routed: `min over routed samples c of travel(c) + max over vertices |v - c|`,
  assuming a straight walk inside the room to `c` is clear (`ceiling_assumes`). Otherwise `not_decidable`, with the
  reason: not convex, curved wall, island, or `k of N sample points found no route` (a start inside furniture).
- Measuring opens **no transaction**: the Find* calls are computations. `create_paths: true` is the only write:
  dry run → `confirmation_token` → apply creates one `PathOfTravel` per measured room in its plan, re-read after
  the commit (owner view + length within max(50 mm, 1 %) of the measured route).
- Honest limits: one level per plan view. A room with no declared exit matched on its level (egress through a
  stair) is `not_assessable` — exits on another level are never flattened into the route. A requested room on a
  level no given plan shows, in another phase than the plan's, or in a secondary design option is `not_decidable`
  with `out of scope: ...`; with `room_ids` omitted such rooms are only counted (`coverage.travel_distance.
  rooms_not_asked_out_of_scope`). Obstacles are what the plan shows, in its phase. A plan whose crop box is active is
  refused (Revit ignores what lies outside the crop and `Create` throws there).
- `create_paths` is refused under `permission_profile=read_only`; the check and the measurement stay available there
  and under `force_read_only_on_workshared`. One room whose `PathOfTravel.Create` throws is that room's unverified row.
- In a requirement set, a rule `{ "measure": "travel_distance_m", "operator": "lte", "value": 45 }` with its own
  `config: { route_view_id | route_view_ids, exits }` is measured under its own key; two rules with different
  exits are two measurements. `coverage.travel_distance` is keyed by rule id.
### `horizun_link_schedule` — 4D

`operation`: `import` (file only), `match` (read), `write` and `status_view`
(MutatingUnlessDryRun: dry run by default, `confirmation_token`, `idempotency_key`).

- Formats by extension: `.xml` MS Project MSPDI (summary tasks and UID 0 skipped;
  `Id` is the UID), `.csv`/`.txt` with header `id,name,start,finish[,wbs,percent_complete,actual_start,actual_finish]`
  (Spanish aliases accepted; `,` `;` or TAB), `.xer` Primavera P6 (TASK rows, WBS
  path from PROJWBS without the project node, WBS summary rows skipped). Dates must
  be ISO (`yyyy-MM-dd`…): `05/02/2026` is rejected by line, never guessed. A DTD in
  the XML is refused.
- `match`: `{parameter, key: id|wbs}` — candidates are the model elements that carry
  the parameter; or `{rules:[{activity, category, level?, parameter?, value?}]}`.
  An element whose key names two activities, or that two rules assign differently,
  is `ambiguous` and linked to neither. Reply lists links, elements without activity
  and activities without elements.
- `write`: `{activity_parameter, start_parameter?, finish_parameter?}` — TEXT INSTANCE
  parameters only; a missing, read-only, non-text parameter or a group member is an
  unresolved row. A refused `Set` rolls the batch back; every row is re-read.
- `status_view`: `view_id`, `as_of`. Duplicates the view (the source is untouched),
  detaches the copy from its template and colours each linked element: done green,
  in_progress amber, future grey, late red. `late` needs percent complete or actual
  dates; without them the status is the planned one. Each override is re-read.
  The token binds the schedule file's SHA-256: an edited file is a stale plan.

### `horizun_federation_check` — federation QA (read-only)

`rules`: `models:[{match, discipline?, allowed_categories?, forbidden_categories?}]`
(`match` is a regex on the model title, `$host` for the host; a model no rule claims
is `unclassified`, two rules make it `ambiguous`), `expected_links:[{name_matches,
count?=1, workset_matches?}]` (missing / fewer / duplicated / wrong workset, and
links no entry expected), `same_site` (default true). Same site is measured: three
points of each link are taken to shared coordinates through the link's own
project location and through the instance transform plus the host's; the largest
disagreement is compared with `tolerance_mm` (default 10). An unloaded link is
`not_decidable`. Link workset and phase are reported.

`levels_match` (`true` or `{tolerance_mm}`; default the call's `tolerance_mm`)
compares every level of every LOADED link, taken into host coordinates through
the instance's total transform (`ProjectElevation`, so the Elevation Base setting
does not matter), with the host's levels. Per link: `matches`, `differs` or
`not_read` (unloaded or unreadable - never counted as matching). Each mismatch is
`elevation_differs` (same name, height beyond tolerance), `name_differs` (a host
level at that height under another name; names compare ordinally, so a case
change counts) or `no_host_level`. Host levels the link does not carry are listed
in `host_levels_not_in_link` and not judged. Any `differs` fails the verdict; any
`not_read` makes it `not_decidable`, and so does a host with no link instance: zero links
compared (`summary.links_compared`) is never a pass. `levels_match: false` (like
`same_site: false`) asks for nothing, so alone it is refused as declaring nothing.

### Resumen (español)

  geométricas). Las normas son datos en `standards/`; cada regla cita norma y
  numeral; lo no calculable o no verificado es `not_decidable`, nunca `passes`.
- `horizun_link_schedule`: 4D con MS Project XML, CSV o XER; empareja por parámetro
  o reglas sin elegir nunca entre dos actividades; escribe actividad/fechas y
  colorea una vista duplicada por estado, con ensayo, token y relectura.
- `horizun_federation_check`: categorías fuera de lugar por modelo, vínculos
  esperados/faltantes/duplicados, workset y fase, y coordenadas compartidas
  coherentes medidas en tres puntos.

## Spatial coherence after every write (`spatial_check`, `horizun_verify_changes`)

A typed write re-reads its postconditions: that proves the request was carried out,
not that the result makes sense. Measured in field use: a modelling session left a
column and a door in the same place with every postcondition true.

**Automatic.** Every call that leaves the model changed carries `spatial_check`, and
`attention` as the FIRST key of the reply when it found something. The dispatcher
watches `DocumentChanged` for the duration of the call (`Core/ChangeWatch.cs`), keeps
what the call added or modified after its own rollbacks, and checks those model
elements (`Core/SpatialCoherence.cs`): every element whose solid intersects theirs
(`ElementIntersectsElementFilter`), the shared volume (`BooleanOperationsUtils`), and
how the two relate. The rules (`Core/SpatialCoherenceRules.cs`, unit-tested) judge:

| Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|
| door or window sharing **3 L or more** of solid with a column, beam, another wall, MEP, furniture, stair | error — blocked opening |
| a door's frame touching its floor or the wall beside it (**under 3 L**; measured 0.1–1.1 L on a real model) | expected, not a finding |
| a wall, column or stair filling **10 L or more** of the 0.6 m clear zone in front of or behind a walk-through door (**1.80 m or taller**) | error — passage blocked |
| an intersection Revit could not measure | at most a warning, never silently clean |
| two elements of the same type occupying ≥95 % of the same volume | error — duplicate |
| duct/pipe/tray/conduit through a structural column, beam or foundation | error — clash |
| MEP against MEP without a connector between them | warning |
| same category overlapping without a join (walls, floors, columns) | warning |
| furniture, fixtures, equipment against structure or each other | warning |
| host and hosted, joined elements, MEP connected, curtain members, the structural frame (beam–column–slab), walls on slabs, MEP through walls/floors | expected, not a finding |
| shared volume below ~28 cm³ (touching faces) | nothing |

It never rolls anything back — the write already committed and verified what was
asked. It is bounded (800 elements, 8 s) and says `partial` when a bound stopped it.
Loaded Revit links are examined too: each changed solid is carried into the link's
coordinates and judged by category (host/join/connector relations do not cross
files); an unloaded link is listed in `links_skipped`, never counted as clear.
`HORIZUN_SPATIAL_CHECK=off` disables it for a process, for a bulk import that checks
once at the end.

**Data-only tools now get a bounded look too.** Parameters, keynotes, worksets,
materials, schedules, views… used to be skipped outright: `DocumentChanged` cannot
tell a moved element from a renamed one, and checking every parameter write in full
would pay a solid-intersection pass for a rename. But a parameter write CAN move
geometry — an offset, a base height, a type swap — so `Core/DataOnlyGeometryRules.cs`
(backed by a bounded `Core/BBoxCache.cs`) decides per element instead of skipping the
tool: a modified element whose bounding box differs from the one recorded the last
time ANY Horizun call saw it (moved beyond ~3 mm) is always checked; an element never
seen before this Revit session is checked only when there are at most 200 such
elements across the call, whole, never partially. Above that cap the check is
skipped for that write and `spatial_check.scope` (or `.scope_note`) says exactly how
many elements and why — a documented limit, not a silent gap. `horizun_verify_changes`
remains the way to look at those elements explicitly afterwards.

**On demand.** `horizun_verify_changes` checks the elements a Horizun write in the
active document changed, or the `element_ids` given, and returns the findings plus an
IMAGE: a temporary isometric 3D view with a section box around them — blue changed,
red in an error, orange in a warning, annotations hidden — created in a transaction
group that is always rolled back (`image.temporary_view_rollback = RolledBack`). Call
it after a modelling batch and look at the image: the check sees solids, not intent (a
wrong level or room, or a missing element, needs the picture).

The camera is framed on the elements for every `orientation` (isometric, top, front,
right): the eye stands outside their box on the viewer side and the crop's depth range
(a 3D view's near/far clip) covers the whole box. It used to keep the eye and depth of
the default isometric view, and 75 walls on a level at +30 m seen from `top` came back
as a blank image. The exported PNG is then MEASURED: `image.content` gives the
background colour and how many pixels differ from it, and an image that is effectively
all background (fewer than max(25 px, 0.05 %) content pixels) is reported as
`captured: false` with `finding: "blank_image"` and no attached image, never as a
capture. An image that cannot be decoded says `content.measured: false`.

- `scope` (default `last_write`): the previous behaviour, unchanged — only the most
  recent Horizun write in this document (kept in memory since Revit started).
  `scope=session` instead unions every write's added/modified ids since Revit started
  (or `since_utc`, an ISO-8601 UTC instant), so several writes in a row get checked
  together; `ChangeLedger` now keeps a bounded (500 writes) history per document
  alongside the "last write" entry it always kept. The union is capped at 2000 distinct
  ids, gathered from the MOST RECENT write backwards, so a cut drops the oldest writes and
  never the one just made — `scope.truncated` and `scope.truncated_why` say so when it was
  cut (oldest-first, a 485-write session once left its last write unchecked). Passing
  `element_ids` overrides `scope` entirely, as before.
- `include_annotation=true` additionally runs the TAG/TEXT-NOTE OVERLAP check
  (`Core/TagOverlapRules.cs` for the pure 2D rectangle geometry, `Core/TagOverlapCheck.cs`
  for the Revit-side gathering): every `IndependentTag` and `TextNote` in the relevant
  view(s), compared pairwise by their VIEW-COORDINATE bounding box
  (`Element.get_BoundingBox(view)` — not model space; annotation is drawn flat on the
  sheet or view). Two tags/text notes stacked on top of each other are reported; two
  tags of the SAME host element that overlap are called out by name ("two tags of the
  same element overlap"). A LABEL-ONLY tag whose extent Revit does not expose through
  that call is `unmeasured`, never folded into "clear" — the check did not look at it.
  `view_ids` names the view(s) explicitly (each must resolve to a view in this
  document, or the call is refused); omitted, it defaults to the owning view of any
  tag/text note already in scope, else the active view of THIS document. Findings
  land in `annotation_check` and fold into the same `attention` headline as
  `spatial_check`. `horizun_annotate` also gets this automatically and for free right
  after it creates a tag or text note — capped to at most 3 owning views so the
  automatic pass stays cheap; a batch that annotated more views calls
  `horizun_verify_changes(include_annotation=true, view_ids=[...])` explicitly.

### Visual diff before/after (`operation=snapshot` / `operation=compare_to`)

`operation` defaults to `check` (everything above). Two more operations turn the same
capture path into a before/after comparison; both need `target_document` (the mutation
gate, because the temporary view is created and then rolled back like the check's own
picture). As in the check, the rollback is not a footnote: when it does not confirm, or
the temporary view still resolves in the document afterwards, the call fails with
`temporary_view_not_rolled_back` and `write_started: true` (delete the view with
`horizun_delete_verified`). A capture that failed after a confirmed rollback answers
`capture_failed` with `write_started: false`.

- **`snapshot`** saves a named baseline: `snapshot_name` (sanitised to letters, digits,
  `-`, `_`, `.`; kept per document) plus EITHER `element_ids` — the camera is framed
  around them exactly like the check's image (padded section box, `orientation`, crop
  fitted to the box) — OR an orthographic 3D view (`view_id`, else the active 3D view)
  whose own orientation and active crop/section box are reused. Refused seeds: one with
  neither box active (Revit would refit to the model's extents, so an element added far
  away would move the whole frame), a perspective camera view
  (`perspective_seed_not_supported`: the capture view is orthographic and a perspective
  crop box means something else there) and a sketched crop region
  (`non_rectangular_crop_not_supported`). The camera stored is the one Revit APPLIED to
  the temporary view (read back after the commit), not the one requested, in
  `%USERPROFILE%\.horizun\verify\baselines\<doc-key>\<name>.png` + `.json`. `<doc-key>`
  is the document title plus a hash of its path, so two models with the same file name
  never share baselines; the json also records `document_path` (compare_to refuses
  another document with `baseline_other_document`), the camera (eye, up, forward,
  section and crop boxes with their transforms), `pixel_size`, `captured_at_utc` /
  `captured_at_ticks` and the PNG's `png_sha256`. Both files are written under temporary
  names, re-read (the PNG must decode, the hash must match), and only then moved over
  the previous pair; `replaced_existing` (with `replaced_captured_at_utc`) says when a
  same-named baseline was overwritten.
- **`compare_to`** (`snapshot_name` of an existing baseline) first refuses a PNG that no
  longer matches its camera's hash (`baseline_unpaired`: an interrupted snapshot or a
  replaced file), then rebuilds a temporary view from the STORED camera — not from
  whatever the live view looks like now — and checks that Revit applied it: view and up
  directions, the crop rectangle within half a pixel, the section box within
  max(half a pixel, 1e-3 ft). Otherwise, or when the image size differs, it refuses with
  `frame_not_reproduced` and both cameras, instead of diffing misaligned pixels
  (`camera_reproduced` reports the tolerance and the deviation measured). It exports at
  the same `pixel_size` and diffs with `Core/ImageDiff`: per-pixel max(|ΔR|,|ΔG|,|ΔB|)
  above 24 counts as changed, the mask is dilated by 2 px, and a region is kept only with
  at least 8 RAW changed pixels (so an isolated antialiasing speck is dropped whatever
  the dilation). Returns `before_path`, `after_path`, `diff_path` (the after image with
  the dilated mask painted red), all three re-read before `artifacts_verified: true`;
  `changed_pixel_ratio` (measured on the RAW mask); `regions` (up to 50, largest first)
  each with `pixel_bbox`, `pixel_count` (raw), `model_bbox_approx` (the pixel rectangle
  swept through the section box's depth — the crop's near/far range without one — and
  clipped to the section box, feet: a bound on where the change is, not an element box)
  and `element_ids`: the elements changed since the baseline whose bounding box,
  projected into the image through the same crop map (`Core/CropPixelMap`), touches the
  region. `elements_changed_since_baseline` lists the ids `ChangeLedger` recorded for
  Horizun writes after the capture (compared by ticks) in this Revit session — manual
  edits are not in the ledger, although they do show in the pixels. Deleted elements are
  only counted (`elements_deleted_since_baseline_count`): a region they caused has no
  `element_ids`. The ledger keeps the last 500 writes per document; when older writes
  since the baseline were evicted, `change_history_evicted` and
  `elements_changed_since_baseline_truncated` are true.

Typical use: `snapshot` on the elements about to be touched, model, then `compare_to`
and look at `diff_path`. PNG decoding/encoding runs in the add-in through WPF imaging
(PresentationCore, referenced on net48, net8 and net10); `Core/ImageDiff` itself only
sees `int[]` ARGB arrays, so its threshold, dilation and labelling are unit-tested on
plain net8. To measure live (probe `visual-diff`): whether Revit's export adds a margin
around the crop (the attribution tolerates 6 px), whether a read-back camera is
re-applied within the tolerances above, and how far a recapture of an unchanged scene
is from exactly 0.

### Equipment clearance zones (`clearance_rules`)

The door clear zone generalised to any equipment a project declares: a panelboard's
front working space, an air handler's service side, a valve's overhead access. No
distance or catalogue is compiled in - a rule is caller data, so the check stays
organisation-neutral:

```json
"clearance_rules": [
  { "category": "OST_ElectricalEquipment", "family_contains": "panel", "face": "front",
    "depth_mm": 900, "width_extra_mm": 150, "height_mm": 2000 }
]
```

- `category` (required): a `BuiltInCategory` token (`OST_*`). `family_contains` /
  `type_contains` (optional): case-insensitive substrings of the instance's family /
  type name. The FIRST rule an instance satisfies, in declaration order, applies.
- `face`: `front` (default) - a box off the face the instance looks out of; `all` -
  front, back, left and right; `top` - a box above the equipment. Front/back/left/right
  are read in the instance's OWN frame (from its own solids), so a rotated instance
  keeps its front. A face-based / work-plane-based instance (a panel hosted on a wall
  face) looks out along its transform's Z, not its `FacingOrientation`, which lies in
  the host face; one with no horizontal front is reported, never skipped.
- `depth_mm` (required, > 0): how far the zone extends off the face (for `top`, how
  high). `width_extra_mm` (default 0): added on EACH side of the equipment's own
  width. `height_mm` (default 2000): the working-space height, measured up from the
  instance's LEVEL (its own, its schedule level, or its host's), not its underside -
  a panel mounted 1.2 m up still sees a low cabinet in front of it - and never lower
  than the equipment's own top.
- Obstacles are physical elements of the document AND of every loaded link (the zone
  is carried into the link's coordinates, the same path the pair check uses for
  links), intersected on solids with the door clear zone's own code path. The
  equipment's own host (a panel's wall), its nested components, floors, ceilings,
  roofs, the structural frame, railings, doors and windows are never obstacles; an
  MEP run connected to the equipment by a connector is expected, not an invasion.
- Findings read `clearance zone of <equipment> is invaded by <element>`: an ERROR for
  a wall, column, stair, curtain panel/mullion or other equipment (electrical,
  mechanical, specialty, or any category a rule names); a WARNING for anything else
  (furniture, casework, MEP runs). The door calibration applies: an intrusion under
  10 L is ignored, and a volume Revit could not measure stays a finding.
- Scope, like the door clear zone: ruled equipment in the checked elements, AND ruled
  equipment the call did not touch that lies within the largest rule's reach of a
  checked element - so placing a column in front of an existing panel is caught by the
  column's own write. Link obstacles are looked for only around equipment in scope.
- A malformed rule is refused by index (`clearance_rules[1].category must be ...`)
  before anything is read: a value of the wrong JSON type (`"900mm"`, `null` for
  `depth_mm`) and a category this Revit does not know (`OST_ElectricalEquipments`,
  wrong case) included.
- `spatial_check.equipment_clearance` reports `zoned` (ruled instances whose zones were
  built and searched) and `not_measured` (id + reason, e.g. no horizontal front). Any
  not-measured instance or unreadable file rule makes the answer `partial`, never
  `clean`.

**Where rules come from.** `horizun_verify_changes(clearance_rules=[...])` always
wins (`spatial_check.clearance_rules_source = "argument"`). Without the argument - and
in the AUTOMATIC `spatial_check` after every write - the rules are read, in this
order: (1) the project's own `clearance-rules.json`, found walking up at most four
folders from the active document's file; the walk stops at the folder holding
`project-context.json` (the project root), whose closed schema has no place for rules;
(2) `%USERPROFILE%\.horizun\clearance-rules.json`; (3) neither: no equipment clearance
check - the door clear zone still runs. Both files are a plain array of rules (or an
object with a `clearance_rules` array). Only a LITERAL `[]` in the project file is an
opt-out that also silences step 2; a file whose entries are all malformed is not.
`spatial_check.clearance_rules_source` names the source without an absolute path;
file errors come back in `spatial_check.clearance_rules_errors` and make the answer
`partial`, never a failure of the write it follows. Live probe:
`scripts/live-probes/clearance-zones.probes.ps1`.

## Field notes: naming side effects and a read-only add-in's own writes

Three usage notes from a 2026-09-25 field session, kept here rather than invented
into a new tool, per the standing rule that this bridge is organisation-neutral
and states observed behaviour rather than a company's policy:

- **Renaming a workset takes the whole workset into your ownership.**
  `horizun_manage_worksets` `rename` calls Revit's `WorksetTable.RenameWorkset`,
  and on a central/local model that checks the workset out to the caller like any
  other edit to it - every element already owned by someone else on that workset is
  unaffected, but the workset itself (and anything not yet owned by anyone) is now
  borrowed by whoever renamed it, exactly as if they had edited an element on it.
  This is a Revit workset-ownership behaviour, not something `rename` adds on top;
  the reply's `owner`/`borrowed_by_other` fields on other operations describe the
  same mechanism from the element side.
- **Renaming a level renames its homonymous views.** A newly created level in
  Revit creates matching plan views named after it (Level 1 -> "Level 1"); Revit's
  own UI renames a level's floor plan/ceiling plan views along with it when the
  level is renamed through the normal path. A script or add-in that changes a
  `Level` element's name through a path that does not trigger that side effect can
  leave the level and its views out of sync in a way that reads as "the level
  renamed but the plan didn't". Worth checking after any level rename, typed or
  via `horizun_execute_python`.
- **A "read-only" mode is not automatically read-only for an external add-in.** A
  third-party add-in's own "read-only" or "audit" mode can still open a
  Transaction and commit it - for example creating a temporary 3D or schedule view
  to drive its report, then deleting that view when it finishes. From outside, this
  looks exactly like the kind of side effect `horizun_execute_python`'s own
  `read_only=true` is built to prevent for OUR scripts (see the top-level tool
  description): a transient view created and removed within one call. It is not
  necessarily a defect in that add-in, but a caller auditing "did anything change"
  around a third-party tool must not assume a name like "read-only" describes what
  the Revit API actually recorded - re-read the model, the way `read_only_check`
  does here, rather than trusting the label.

**Calibration on a real model (2026-09-26).** A read-only pass over a detached copy of a
real architecture model (Revit 2025, 234 doors) first reported 157 errors: door frames
embedded 0.1–1.1 L in floors and adjacent walls, a clear zone as deep as the door is wide
(a 2.6 m balcony door "saw" its parapet), and a gas-meter niche door "blocked" by its own
back wall. With the 3 L opening threshold, a fixed 0.6 m zone, walk-through doors only
(≥ 1.80 m) and a bounding-box prefilter, the same pass finished in 24 s with one finding -
a chute hatch against its hopper whose volume Revit could not measure, now a warning.
A column in a doorway (51 L) and one 0.7 m in front of a door still come back as errors.

## horizun_fix_planimetry: non-rectangular (polygon) crops

`set_crop` accepts `crop.loop` - a closed polygon of at least 3 `[x, y]`
view-plane points - as an alternative to `crop.min`/`crop.max`. It is refused BY
NAME (not as a capability gap) on a view whose
`ViewCropRegionShapeManager.CanHaveShape` is false; a rectangle is unaffected by
this and still goes through `View.CropBox`.

- **The polygon is written through `SetCropShape(CurveLoop)`, then cleaned up in
  the same transaction.** `SetCropShape` was MEASURED (Revit 2026, 2026-08-25, on
  a rectangular loop, the live gate) to install a crop-region sketch and create
  two non-view-specific `Dimension` elements as a side effect - elements that were
  still there after the shape was removed again. A command whose contract is that
  it writes only what it names cannot leave those behind, so `Apply` diffs the
  document's `Dimension` elements immediately before and after `SetCropShape`,
  and deletes whatever appeared, before the transaction that holds them ever
  commits. The assumption behind this - that those dimensions are UI witnesses of
  the sketch's constraints and not the shape's geometry, so removing them leaves
  the polygon intact - is UNVERIFIED beyond the rectangular-loop measurement above;
  it has NOT been measured live for an actual polygon loop. If it is wrong, the
  rehearsal's and the apply's own re-read of the shape (vertex by vertex, see
  below) simply fails the postcondition and the whole batch rolls back - it can
  never silently report success over a broken shape or a model that kept the
  extra elements. A live probe of `horizun_fix_planimetry` needs a case
  that actually sets a polygon crop and inspects the model's `Dimension` count
  before/after to close this gap.
- **Verification compares vertices, not a bounding box.** `crop_shape`'s postcondition
  re-reads `ViewCropRegionShapeManager.GetCropShape()`'s loop and matches every
  requested vertex to a distinct read vertex within the batch's tolerance
  (default 0.1 mm, well inside the 1 mm this feature targets) - unordered, since
  Revit is free to start or wind the loop however it likes. A rectangle's crop
  still compares as a bounding box, unchanged.

## horizun_fix_planimetry: `set_view_display` (detail level and discipline)

`set_view_display` sets `View.DetailLevel` and/or `View.Discipline` of ONE view,
citing a finding about that view - in practice a requirement-set rule of
`horizun_audit_planimetry` with `entity: "view"` and `field: "detail_level"` or
`"discipline"` (the same property names `horizun_model_scan`'s `view_profile`
judges as `expected_detail_level` / `expected_discipline`). No universal check
maps to it, so a universal finding cannot cite it.

```json
{ "operation": "set_view_display", "finding": { "...": "copied verbatim" },
  "view_id": 12345, "detail_level": "Fine", "discipline": "Architectural" }
```

- **Values are the audit's own spelling, exactly.** `detail_level` is `Coarse`,
  `Medium` or `Fine` (`Undefined` is a reading, never a target); `discipline` is
  `Architectural`, `Structural`, `Mechanical`, `Electrical`, `Plumbing` or
  `Coordination`. Case is not forgiven, because the re-read compares strings.
- **At least one of the two**, otherwise the action names nothing and is refused.
- **Refused BY NAME before any transaction** when the view's template controls
  the parameter (`GetTemplateParameterIds` minus
  `GetNonControlledTemplateParameterIds` contains `VIEW_DETAIL_LEVEL` /
  `VIEW_DISCIPLINE`): the assignment would be overwritten by the template. The
  remedies are `set_view_template` or an edit of the template itself. Also refused
  on a template, a sheet or a schedule, when `HasDetailLevel` /
  `HasViewDiscipline` is false, and when `CanModifyDetailLevel` /
  `CanModifyViewDiscipline` is false.
- **Re-read after the commit:** the requested value(s) must read back, and the
  property NOT requested must read back exactly as it was before
  (`detail_level_unchanged` / `discipline_unchanged`). The audit then re-runs and
  reports the cited finding as resolved or persistent.

## horizun_deliver_ifc: telling an empty parameter apart from a dropped mapping

`model_comparison` (inside the `pset_mapping` gate's evidence) merges a
BEFORE-export read of the model with the AFTER-export coverage check, per
declared property: `exported`, `empty_in_model`, `not_applied`,
`parameter_missing`. The model-side read resolves each mapping row's IFC
classes to a Revit category through a built-in table
(`DeliverIfcCommand.IfcClassCategories`) covering common architecture,
structure and MEP classes (walls, slabs, columns, beams, doors, windows,
stairs, railings, spaces, ducts, pipes, cable trays, flow terminals,
electrical appliances...). A class outside that table makes the ROW
`category_unmapped` - the model is not read for it, and only the file's own
coverage (unaffected) is known.

`exported` and `not_applied` are **aggregate** counts, not element-matched: no
IFC GlobalId correlates a specific model element to its file entity without
recomputing the exporter's own GUID algorithm (this bridge does not carry
that algorithm). The arithmetic (`not_applied = max(0, has_value - carrying)`)
holds as long as the model census and the file's coverage check are counting
the SAME population; a `population_mismatch_note` on the row says so whenever
the heuristic category resolution and the file's own IFC-class count disagree,
rather than trusting the aggregate silently. `PsetMapping.CombineWithModel`
(Revit-free) does the merge; `DeliverIfcCommand.ComputeModelCensus` (Revit-
side) builds the per-row model counts.

## horizun_health: the verification catalog and modal-dialog detail

`include_verification_catalog=true` adds a `verification_catalog` block: for
every writing tool, its `mechanism` (the enum name from `WriteVerificationCatalog`
- `PostconditionChecklist`, `PerRowReread`, `CountReconciliation`,
`FileArtifactReread`, `DelegatedChildDeclaration`, `RemoteAcknowledgement`,
`RemoteReread`, `QueuedNotExecuted` or `SelfReported`) and `residual_gap_count` (how many known,
unfixed gaps the catalog still names for it - 0 means none are DECLARED, not that
the tool is flawless). `full_text_source` points at the source file
(`src/Horizun.Revit/Core/WriteVerificationCatalog.cs`), where every gap's own
sentence, evidence fields and source files actually live; the summary is kept
out of the default reply (`include_verification_catalog` defaults to `false`)
so an ordinary health call stays small.

**A blocked UI thread is diagnosed from a thread that is not blocked.** When
Revit's UI thread is stuck on a modal dialog, no typed command - `horizun_health`
included - can run there to answer: `ICommand.Execute` is never called, because
the ExternalEvent the bridge raises is only serviced when Revit is idle. The
"Revit has a MODAL DIALOG open" and timeout failures a queued request gets
instead come from `Dispatcher.cs`/`ModalProbe.cs`, which read the dialog's own
Win32 window from a background thread (never the UI thread) and never click or
post to it. Both failures now carry a structured `modal_dialog` block in
`structuredContent` beside the prose message:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `dialog_window_found` | false means only "the main window is disabled" is known - the dialog itself could not be enumerated (it can live on another thread of the same process) |
| `title`, `class_name` | `GetWindowText`/`GetClassName` of the dialog window itself (`#32770` is the generic Windows dialog class) |
| `main_text` | best-effort: the LONGEST text found on a direct `Static`/`SysLink` child - a heuristic, because a dialog can carry several short labels besides its real message |
| `all_text` | every `Static`/`SysLink` child's text this probe could read, in enumeration order, so a caller can judge `main_text`'s guess for themselves |
| `buttons` | every `Button` child's caption, in enumeration order |
| `owning_module` | `GetWindowModuleFileName` for the dialog - which module's window class this is (Revit's own core, or a third-party add-in's dialog on the same UI thread); null when Win32 could not resolve it |

A null field means Win32 could not read it, never that the dialog has no such
thing. `modal_dialog` is absent (not merely null) when the probe itself is
unavailable or the main window is enabled.

## horizun_cde_cloud: ACC Issues (`issues_list`, `issue_create`, `issue_update`)

`provider=acc` only. The full flow (key marker, 3-legged `data:write`, read-back) is in
[INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT.md, "ACC Issues from coordination findings"](INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT.md#acc-issues-from-coordination-findings).
The arguments the schema keeps terse:

| argument | meaning |
|---|---|
| `issue` | the issue fields, every value a string: `title`, `description`, `issue_type_id` (the ACC **subtype** id - `issues_list` returns `issue_types` with their subtypes), `status` (`draft`, `open`, `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `in_review`, `not_approved`, `in_dispute`, `closed`), `assigned_to`, `assigned_to_type` (`user` default, `company`, `role`), `due_date` and `start_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `location_id`, `root_cause_id`. In `issues_list` only `status`, `issue_type_id` and `assigned_to` are accepted, as filters. |
| `finding` | one coordination-ledger row: a row of this bridge's own ledger (the `horizun_coordination` CSV columns or JSON keys) as it is, or another tool's row. Column aliases (case-insensitive, spaces read as `_`, first present wins): title ← `title`, `name`, `summary`, `clash_name`, `check`, else `Clash: <category_a> vs <category_b>` (the ledger has no title column); description ← `description`, `detail`, `details`, `comment`, `message`, `reason`, `note`, plus a `column: value` line for each context column (`category_a`, `category_b`, `side_a`, `side_b`, `point_mm`, `priority`, `responsible`, `immovable_discipline`, `suggested_action`, `scope`, `severity`, `discipline`, `category`, `test`, `level`, `grid`, `location`, `zone`, `element_a`, `element_b`, `element_ids`, `elements`, `distance`, `point`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `source`, `model`); key ← `external_key`, `finding_id`, `clash_id`, `issue_key`, `guid`, `id`. `issue` overrides the finding. |
| `external_key` | 1-100 characters of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ : -`, stored as `[horizun-key:<key>]` on the last line of the description. Required on create (or a finding id). An `issue_update` naming a key the issue does not carry yet WRITES the marker (its text kept) - it is part of the plan and of `changes`. In `issues_list` it selects the issues carrying it. |
| `issue_id` | the ACC issue id (UUID). `issue_update` also finds the issue by its key when `issue_id` is absent. |
| `dry_run`, `confirmation_token` | the writes rehearse by default; the apply sends the same arguments with `dry_run=false` and the rehearsal's token. |

Reply of a write: `state` (`rehearsed`, `applied`, `applied_unverified`,
`already_exists`, `no_change`), `plan`, `changes` (update), `issue_id`, `display_id`,
`web_url`, `verification` and `host_verified`, `mapped_from_finding`, `external_key`,
`attachments` (always "none" in this pass), `auth` and `http`. A 2-legged-only
configuration is refused before any request, with the steps to obtain a 3-legged token.

What the verdict rests on:

- **The read-back.** Every field sent is compared with a GET after the write; the
  description is compared WHOLE (line endings and outer whitespace normalised), not by
  containment, so a PATCH that never landed does not pass because the old text still
  contains the new one, and an emptied description is compared too. Nothing compared
  is never `host_verified`.
- **A lost answer.** A POST is not retried. A 5xx, a transport loss, or a 2xx whose body is
  empty or not a JSON object is reconciled by scanning for the key again (`reconciled`);
  a 2xx PATCH without a usable body goes straight to the read-back.
- **The idempotency scan** reads every issue page sorted by `displayId` (fixed at creation),
  so an issue edited during the scan cannot move to a page already read. A scan that could
  not finish withholds the token.
- **The call budget.** The dry run withholds its token when `max_calls` leaves no room for
  the write and its read-back; the apply checks the same before the POST/PATCH, so a spent
  budget is "no request was made", never a possibly-landed write.
- **The token file.** A refresh asks no scope, so APS keeps the scopes of the original
  sign-in: a read no longer leaves a `data:read`-only token behind. A stored token that is
  still valid but lacks `data:write` is refreshed for a write instead of being reused.
  (That APS v2 accepts a refresh without `scope`, and that the Issues list accepts
  `sortBy=displayId`, are to be measured live.)

Live probe: `scripts/live-probes/cde-cloud-issues.probes.ps1` (read-only cases; the apply
is `not_covered` and is run by hand, with the user's approval, against a test project).

## horizun_framing: light-gauge / drywall framing from a detail

A consultancy often models, from wall-type and ceiling DETAILS (received as images or
2-D DWG details), the framing the finished walls and ceilings hide. `horizun_framing`
builds exactly that framing from a typed **spec**. It never reads an image: the MCP
client (a vision-capable model, guided by the prompt `framing-from-detail`) reads the
detail into the spec, the person confirms it, and the tool builds and re-reads it.
Families, sizes, spacings and rules are the caller's data; nothing organisation-specific
is compiled in.

| operation | writes | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `wall` | yes | studs, tracks, kings, jacks, headers, sills, cripples and blocking inside one layer of each straight Basic wall in `element_ids` (or visible in `view_id`, where curtain, stacked and curved walls are listed in `plan.skipped` with their reason instead of refusing the call; named in `element_ids` they refuse) |
| `ceiling` | yes | mains, cross (furring) channels, perimeter track and hangers for each Ceiling in `element_ids` (or visible in `view_id`, where sloped, multi-region and sketchless ceilings are listed in `plan.skipped` with their reason; named in `element_ids` they refuse), the hangers ray-cast to the structure above |
| `read` | no | what a previous apply produced, per source, found by the marker on each member (`member_count` counts members; `work_plane_count` counts work planes, which this build no longer creates) |
| `remove` | yes | deletes the members (and any work planes an earlier build created) a previous apply produced for `element_ids`, verified |

Every write rehearses first (`dry_run` defaults to true) and returns a
`confirmation_token` that binds the operation, the sources, the spec and the RESOLVED
PLAN: every member's role, type and both endpoints. A wall that moved, gained a door or
changed type between the rehearsal and the apply yields another plan, the token no longer
matches, and nothing is written. The apply sends the token and an `idempotency_key`.

### Example: a 92 mm (3-5/8") stud partition at 406 mm (16") on centre

```json
{
  "operation": "wall", "element_ids": [412345], "dry_run": true,
  "spec": { "wall": {
    "layer": "core",
    "stud":  { "type_id": 900101, "spacing_mm": 406.4, "start": "wall_start", "double_at_ends": false, "width_mm": 41.3 },
    "track": { "bottom_type_id": 900102, "top_same_as_bottom": true, "thickness_mm": 0.9 },
    "openings": { "king_studs": 1, "jack_studs": true, "header_type_id": 900102, "sill_type_id": 900102, "cripple_spacing_mm": 406.4,
                  "header_depth_mm": 92.1, "sill_depth_mm": 92.1 },
    "blocking": [ { "height_mm": 1200, "type_id": 900102 } ]
  } }
}
```

### Example: a suspended drywall ceiling (mains at 1200, furring at 400, hangers at 1200)

```json
{
  "operation": "ceiling", "element_ids": [523456], "dry_run": true,
  "spec": { "ceiling": {
    "main":      { "type_id": 900201, "spacing_mm": 1200, "direction": "short", "depth_mm": 38 },
    "cross":     { "type_id": 900202, "spacing_mm": 400, "depth_mm": 22 },
    "perimeter": { "type_id": 900203, "depth_mm": 22 },
    "hanger":    { "type_id": 900204, "spacing_mm": 1200, "max_length_mm": 3000, "attach": "structure_above" },
    "drop_mm": 22
  } }
}
```

### The curtain method (`method: "curtain"`)

Some teams model light-gauge framing with curtain elements instead of one family instance per
member: the partition **core** is a Curtain Wall whose type does the layout (vertical grid at the
stud spacing, interior vertical mullions = studs, border mullions = tracks, panel = infill), and a
suspended ceiling is a stack of **flat Sloped Glazing roofs** (one per layer: mains, furring, the
perimeter angle as the border mullion) plus vertical curtain walls whose mullions are the hanger
rods. `spec.wall.method = "curtain"` / `spec.ceiling.method = "curtain"` builds exactly that from
the caller's own types - type ids only; no type name, spacing or profile is compiled. The default
`method` is `"members"` (everything above).

**Wall.** Input: straight Basic walls - typically the core carrier `horizun_split_multilayer_walls`
leaves, or a single-layer wall.

```json
{ "operation": "wall", "element_ids": [412345],
  "spec": { "wall": { "method": "curtain",
    "curtain_type_id": 1001, "header_type_id": 1002, "sill_type_id": 1002,
    "placeholder_type_id": 1003, "multi_opening": "keep_carrier", "min_segment_mm": 50 } } }
```

Here type 1001 is a Curtain Wall type with a Fixed Distance vertical grid of 406.4 mm, a
41.3 x 92.1 mm rectangular mullion as the interior vertical mullion (the studs) and the track
profile as the border mullions; 1002 is the type for the pieces above and below openings
(`header_type_id` / `sill_type_id` default to `curtain_type_id`); 1003 is a thin Basic wall type.

- The pieces run on the carrier's **core centreline** (the thickest layer's centre when the type
  has no core) in the carrier's direction: segments cover the length minus each opening's span, a
  header sits above every opening (head -> wall top), a sill below every window (base -> sill). A
  piece shorter or lower than `min_segment_mm` is named in `skipped`, never dropped silently.
- **The carrier** keeps its identity and its inserts (no public API re-hosts a door): with ONE
  opening it is trimmed to that opening's span and takes `placeholder_type_id`; with NONE it is
  deleted after the pieces exist (`replaced_by`); with SEVERAL, the default `keep_carrier` keeps it
  full length with the placeholder type, so every door and window keeps its id, tags and data, and
  the pieces are still split around every opening - they **overlap the kept carrier**, which the
  plan and the verified result say in `carrier.overlap` (the result also lists `overlapped_by`, the
  piece ids) and the plan's warnings repeat. `multi_opening: "refuse"` refuses such a wall instead
  and names the reason (split it at the openings first). What deleting a carrier takes along (tags,
  dimensions, hosted families) is measured in a rolled-back transaction, listed in
  `carrier.deleted_with_it`, bound by the token and counted as deletes in `plan_resolved`.
  A kept or trimmed carrier's location line is set to the wall centreline before its type changes,
  so the thinner placeholder stays centred where the carrier was and its doors do not move;
  `carrier.placeholder_offset_from_pieces_mm` says how far that plane is from the pieces' core
  centreline. Refused by name: a carrier with an embedded wall (a storefront), and a wall whose
  every piece would be empty or below `min_segment_mm`. `header_type_id` and `sill_type_id` are
  Curtain Wall types other than the placeholder. What changing a kept or trimmed carrier deletes or
  un-hosts among the elements that depend on it (`Element.GetDependentElements`: hosted and
  face-based families on the length a trim removes or on faces a thinner type moves, sweeps,
  reveals) is rehearsed in a rolled-back transaction, listed in `carrier.change_takes`, bound by
  the token and re-read after the commit (`carrier_change_as_measured`).
- **Verification:** every piece by marker - type, line within 1 mm of the plan, base and top; its
  vertical grid (Fixed Distance: every interior spacing within 1 mm and no edge bay wider than one
  spacing; other layouts: count and first/last line); mullion types per role against the type's
  automatic mullions; the carrier's type, line and location line (wall centreline) as planned,
  its inserts unchanged in type, position and host (against their state before the apply; a
  re-apply compares with their state at that call); no piece embedded in the carrier
  (`pieces_not_embedded`: a type with Automatically Embed on can cut a piece into the carrier,
  which rolls the apply back - the plan warns when a type has it on); the delete cascade exactly
  as measured.
- **Remove** restores the carrier from the record every piece carries: a trimmed or kept carrier
  gets its original type, line and location-line reference back, its inserts left as they were
  when the remove was planned (an edit made to a door since the apply stays); a deleted one is
  created again - a NEW id, named - with its type, line, level, base offset, top constraint,
  location-line reference, flip and structural flag (its mark, comments, phase and workset are not
  restored, nor are the elements its delete took, listed in `deleted_with_carrier_not_restored`;
  the plan says so). A carrier changed
  after the apply is not overwritten: its restore is refused by name and only the pieces go.
  `operation=read` shows each curtain source's carrier record.

**Ceiling.** Input: Ceilings.

```json
{ "operation": "ceiling", "element_ids": [523456],
  "spec": { "ceiling": { "method": "curtain",
    "layers": [ { "type_id": 2001, "offset_mm": 0, "angle_deg": 0 },
                { "type_id": 2002, "offset_mm": 27 } ],
    "hanger": { "type_id": 2003, "spacing_mm": 1200, "max_length_mm": 1500, "attach": "structure_above" } } } }
```

Here 2001 and 2002 are Sloped Glazing roof types (the furring layer on the ceiling, the main layer
27 mm above it) and 2003 a Curtain Wall type whose vertical grid places the rods. 2001 carries its
members on grid 1 and 2002 on grid 2 (grid 1 None): a layer ACROSS another is a type on the other
grid, never `angle_deg: 90` - Revit takes a curtain grid angle within -89..89 only (MEASURED
2026-09-27: 90 was accepted by `Parameter.Set` and refused at the commit), and the parser refuses it.

- Each layer is a flat footprint roof of its type over the ceiling's own sketch (every edge
  `DefinesSlope = false`), its plane at the ceiling's top face + `offset_mm`, its grid 1 angle set
  when `angle_deg` is given (`CURTAINGRID_ANGLE_1`, probed in a rolled-back transaction while
  planning: layer 0 with hangers refuses by name when a roof of its type cannot take it; any other
  layer skips it, named in the warnings and `angle_skipped`). Openings the ceiling hosts, and shafts, are not cut from the layers (named in the plan);
  the hanger lines avoid them. Up to 6 layers.
- Hangers (optional; they need the first layer's `angle_deg`, and a first layer with a grid 1):
  vertical curtain walls along the first layer's grid 1 LINES at `spacing_mm`, clipped to the boundary, from the top layer's
  plane up to the first floor, structural framing or roof above (host or link). Three rays per line
  (both ends and the middle): a line with no support within `max_length_mm`, or whose support is
  not level along it (rods differing by more than 1 mm), is named in `not_built` and never built.
- **Verification:** each layer's type, plane (base level + offset, 1 mm), footprint against the
  ceiling sketch both ways (1 mm), no slope-defining edge, grid 1 direction against `angle_deg`
  (0.1 deg) and each Fixed Distance grid's spacing; each hanger's line, base and top, its own grid
  and mullions, and after the commit a ray up from under its top at every station must meet the
  support within 1 mm.
- Measured live on flat Sloped Glazing roofs (Revit 2026, 2026-09-27), and what the plan and the
  verification now assume: grid 1 is the **V** grid lines and they run at `CURTAINGRID_ANGLE_1 + 90`
  degrees in project coordinates - the angle names the direction the lines are spaced along - while
  grid 2 is the **U** lines, running AT `CURTAINGRID_ANGLE_2`; neither follows the footprint's edges
  (a footprint turned 30 degrees leaves them where they were). The Fixed Distance layout is 1.
  `NewFootPrintRoof` must be handed an already created `ModelCurveArray` although the parameter is
  `out` (a null one throws "Value cannot be null." for any roof type). A disagreement between the
  plan and the re-read grid still fails the postcondition and rolls the edit back.

`horizun_manage_curtain operation=read` also reads a sloped glazing roof's grids (`grid_index`),
with the grid 1 / grid 2 angles, so a layer can be inspected line by line.

### Spec fields and defaults

- **wall.layer**: `"core"` (default) puts the studs on the core's structural layer, else
  the thickest core layer, else the thickest layer (reported as `choice`); an integer is a
  compound layer index, exterior first. A membrane (zero thickness) is refused.
- **wall.stud**: `type_id` and `spacing_mm` required; `start` `wall_start` (default) |
  `wall_end` | `centred`; `max_first_bay_mm`; `double_at_ends` (default false); `width_mm`
  (the flange along the wall; default the type's published section width, refused when
  neither exists).
- **wall.track**: `bottom_type_id` required; `top_type_id` or `top_same_as_bottom`
  (default true when no top type is named); `thickness_mm` (default 0 with a warning:
  studs then run from base to top of wall).
- **wall.openings**: `king_studs` 1 (default) or 2, `jack_studs` (default true),
  `header_type_id`, `sill_type_id`, `cripple_spacing_mm`, `header_depth_mm`, `sill_depth_mm`
  (the header's / sill's section depth in z: the header's axis sits at head + depth/2 on
  the jacks and the cripples above start at head + depth; the sill's axis at sill - depth/2
  and the cripples below end at sill - depth; a blocking row inside that framed depth is
  skipped. Without a depth the axis sits ON the head / sill line, half the member in the
  void, and the plan warns `no_header_depth` / `no_sill_depth`. A header that would rise
  into the top track, or a sill that would sink into the bottom track, is not placed and
  is named in `warnings`). Hosted doors, windows and
  rectangular wall openings are read from the wall (rough size when the family publishes
  it, else nominal, else the bounding box; each opening says which in `read_from`). A stud
  station inside an opening is removed; no stud ever crosses one. A cripple that meets
  ANOTHER opening's framed void (a vent stacked over a door) is cut around it
  (`cripple_cut_by_opening:<own>:<other>`), and one that would overlap a member already
  placed (a `cripple_spacing_mm` barely above the stud width) is dropped
  (`cripple_overlaps_member_dropped:<opening>`). The post-commit `no_stud_through_opening`
  re-read allows the same 1 mm as `member_endpoints`, so a jack flush with the jamb read
  back a hair inside it is round-off, not a crossing.
- **wall.blocking**: up to 20 rows `{height_mm, type_id}`, split at the studs.
- **ceiling.main**: `type_id`, `spacing_mm` required; `direction` `short` | `long`
  (default) | an angle in degrees. **ceiling.cross** `{type_id, spacing_mm}`,
  **ceiling.perimeter** `{type_id}` optional. **ceiling.hanger**: `type_id`, `spacing_mm`
  (along each main) required; `max_length_mm` default 3000; `end_offset_mm` default half
  the spacing; `attach` `structure_above`. **ceiling.drop_mm**: from the ceiling's top face
  up to the mains' underside, default 0 (in the example the furring, 22 mm deep, sits on
  the board and the mains bear on the furring). `depth_mm` on main, cross and perimeter is
  optional: each axis sits half its depth above the face it bears on; without it the axis
  sits ON that face and the plan says so in `warnings`.

### Ceiling geometry

- **Boundary**: the ceiling's own sketch, every loop chained end to end (arcs tessellated),
  the largest loop first; holes are honoured. A sketch with a second region outside the
  largest one is refused (split it into one ceiling per region), and so is a sloped
  ceiling (its box taller than the type's compound width + 1 mm). Under a `view_id` scope
  either one is listed in `plan.skipped` instead, and the call refuses only when every
  ceiling the view shows was skipped.
- **Heights** (model z, mm): cross and perimeter axes at top face + depth/2; mains at top
  face + `drop_mm` + depth/2; each hanger from the mains' top face up to its support.
- **Hangers**: one ray straight up per station, from the mains' top face, against floors,
  structural framing and roofs of the host and of loaded links, in a temporary 3-D view
  that is always rolled back (no template, filters or section box; the ceiling's phase).
  The nearest hit within `max_length_mm` is the support and its distance the rod; a
  horizun_framing member is never a support. A station with nothing above is listed in
  `no_support_above` (main index and point) and NOT placed; the counts, the signature
  and the confirmation token are those of the hangers that will exist.
- **Verification** adds `inside_boundary`: every member end within 1 mm of the sketch
  boundary (holes count), and reports per ceiling `hanger_supports` (support -> hangers).

Spec errors come back together, before anything is read from the model, as
`{path, code, detail}` with code `missing`, `not_object`, `not_integer`, `not_number`,
`not_boolean`, `below_minimum`, `above_maximum`, `bad_value`, `conflict`, `not_array` or
`unknown_field` (the reply's `code` is `invalid_spec`, `write_started` false). Spacings are
bounded to 10..20000 mm, so a spacing typed in inches or metres refuses arithmetically
instead of placing millions of members; a call plans at most 5000 members per source and
20000 in total.

### Category and placement rules

The member's family decides how it is placed, and a family that cannot take the member's
orientation is refused by name before anything is written:

- **Structural Framing** places as a beam (`StructuralType.Beam`) on a HORIZONTAL axis only:
  tracks, headers, sills, blocking, mains, cross, perimeter. Its z-justification is set to
  centre so the axis is the member's centreline, and its automatic joins are switched off
  at both ends: a track or a blocking piece ends where the plan says, against a stud's
  face, instead of being cut back or extended by Revit to meet a column or another beam.
- **Structural Columns** place as a column (`StructuralType.Column`) on a VERTICAL axis only:
  studs, kings, jacks, cripples, hangers.
- **Line-based Generic Model** places HORIZONTAL members only, on the source's level
  (`NewFamilyInstance(Curve, FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType)`), with the height put back
  from the axis. A vertical member of this kind is refused by name: standing a line on a
  created reference plane or sketch plane was refused by Revit for every member ("does not
  coincide with the input face", at 0.000 mm off the plane; MEASURED 2026-09-26 in Revit
  2026) because that overload hosts on a FACE of an element. Studs, kings, jacks, cripples
  and hangers therefore need a Structural Columns type.

The Revit API documents no orientation rule for `NewFamilyInstance(Curve, FamilySymbol,
Level, StructuralType)`, so the tool relies on none: which placements Revit commits and
whether the committed axis keeps the planned ends is what `framing.probes.ps1` measures.
MEASURED 2026-09-26 in Revit 2026 (10/10): a line-based member's location curve stays on
its level and its height is the `Offset from Host` parameter, so the re-read adds it
(`endpoint_read: location_curve_plus_level_offset`); a column placed on a vertical line
reports a location curve (its real axis), not a point with base and top constraints.

### Verification, markers and idempotence

After the commit the tool re-reads, by marker, every planned member: its type, both
endpoints within 1 mm of the plan (a vertical column's ends are read from its base and
top constraints), `|y|` inside the carrying layer, no vertical member inside an opening's
void, counts per role equal to the plan, every hosted insert of the wall with the same
type and location as before, and no member geometry-joined with its source wall
(`source_unjoined`). Revit joins some column families with the wall they stand in and cuts
the wall by them; a stud never cuts the partition it frames, so such a join is undone inside
the write and counted in `evidence.source_joins_undone`. Any disagreement rolls the whole
edit back.

Each member (and work plane) carries an extensible-storage marker naming its source
element (id and UniqueId), role, plan index, spec hash and plan signature. A second apply
of the same spec on the same wall is `already_applied`: nothing is created and the
existing members are re-read against the plan. Framing from another spec on the same
source is refused until `operation=remove` takes it away. Hand-modelled framing carries no
marker and is never read, claimed or removed.

The marker also records the member's OWN UniqueId. Extensible storage travels with a copy,
so a wall copied or arrayed together with its framing brings members whose marker still
names the original wall; their UniqueId no longer matches, so they are **foreign copies**:
`remove` keeps them (`plan.foreign_copies_kept`, `evidence.foreign_copies_kept`), the
idempotence and the re-read never count them, the spatial check never excuses them, and
`read` lists them apart (`foreign_copies`, `foreign_copy_count`).

`remove` measures, in a rolled-back transaction, what Revit deletes WITH the members (tags,
dimensions, anything hosted on the tool's work planes): the rehearsal shows it in
`plan.cascade` (count, by category, ids), the token binds it, and after the commit
`cascade_absent` and `cascade_as_measured` re-read it (`evidence.cascaded_ids`); a cascade
the token did not bind rolls the whole remove back.

A ceiling's hangers are re-cast after the commit: one ray up from just under each rod's top
must meet a floor, framing or roof within 1 mm of that top (`hanger_reaches_support`,
`evidence.hanger_recheck`).

**The automatic spatial check** (`spatial_check` after every write) treats a framing
member and its own source wall or ceiling as an EXPECTED intersection (reason "framing
inside its own source"), read from the marker: studs inside the wall they frame are what was
asked for. Two members of one source are judged by the normal rules: studs meeting tracks
share no volume (no finding), but mains running through cross members (`drop_mm` under the
cross depth) or any real overlap between members is reported. A member touching anything
else is still reported.

**Live probe** (`scripts/live-probes/framing.probes.ps1`, offline twin
`framing.tests.ps1`). On its own level it authors a line-based Generic Model member,
frames an own compound wall with a door and a window (rehearsal, verified apply, second
apply `already_applied`, read, remove), then an own ceiling 600 mm under an own floor
(rehearsal and verified apply: `inside_boundary` matched and every hanger's support is
that floor, by id) and a second ceiling with nothing above (rehearsal: every station
`no_support_above`, no hanger planned). The ceiling framing is removed with
`operation=remove` before the staging is deleted, because its members are not hosted by
the ceiling. A last case frames a wall at 45 degrees with the document's own Structural
Columns type as studs and Structural Framing type as tracks (the Column and Beam placements;
columns re-read from their constraints, beams from their curves) and is `not_covered`, named,
when the document carries neither category.

## horizun_quantities - mode room_finishes

Gross wall, floor and ceiling area of each room or space, per bounding element type,
material and classification code, from Revit's `SpatialElementGeometryCalculator` at the
**finish** face (`SpatialElementBoundaryLocation.Finish`). Read-only.

```json
{ "mode": "room_finishes", "phase": "New Construction", "level": "Level 1", "code_parameter": "Assembly Code" }
```

- `phase` is **required**: rooms, spaces and the side a door faces are per phase, and a hidden
  default would silently measure a different building. `element_ids` (rooms/spaces) or `level`
  narrow the scope; without them every room and space of that phase is measured.
- Each face piece comes from `GetBoundaryFaceInfo`: `SubfaceType.Side` is a wall finish,
  `Bottom` the floor, `Top` the ceiling. A face piece no element bounds (an unbounded room top)
  is its own row under `(no bounding element)`, so the rows still add up to the room.
- `material` is the finish the room sees on that face: the **paint** when the face is painted
  (`Document.IsPainted` / `GetPaintedMaterial`), else the face's own material
  (`Face.MaterialElementId` of `GetBoundingElementFace()`); `material_source` says `paint` or
  `face` (`paint_unreadable` when the paint check failed). Named non-values: `(no material on
  face)`, `(face unreadable)`, and `(separation line: no face)` for a room separation line.
- Rows carry `kind` (room | space) and `totals_by_kind` totals rooms and spaces **apart**: a space
  drawn over a room measures the same faces again, so one sum over both would count every face
  twice. A repeated id in `element_ids` is measured once and listed in `duplicate_ids`.
- **Openings are never netted.** The room solid runs past doors, windows and wall openings, so
  `gross_m2` is gross. `openings_deduction_m2` is a separate column: the inserts of each bounding
  wall (`FindInserts` with rectangular openings and embedded walls) that are **in the wall in the
  phase** (`GetPhaseStatus` New or Existing, or None: not phased) and face this room (a
  door/window of a room: Revit's `FromRoom`/`ToRoom` in the phase; otherwise a point probe on
  each side of the insert). A door/window is sized by `rough` width x height when the family
  publishes it, else `nominal` (`DOOR_`/`WINDOW_`/`FAMILY_` width and height, instance then type),
  else `bounding_box` measured along the wall; a rectangular wall opening by `opening_rect` (its
  `BoundaryRect`). The top-level `openings` list gives EACH opening with `width_m`, `height_m`,
  `area_m2` and `size_basis`, so a rule such as "openings under X m2 are not deducted" can be
  applied. When a wall's faces in one room fall into two rows (two materials), its deductions go to
  the row where it has the most area. Deduct by your contract's rule; this tool computes no net.
- `inserts_other_phase_status` names the inserts of a bounding wall that are Demolished, Past,
  Future or Temporary in the phase (not deducted). `inserts_not_deducted` names the rest: other
  categories, and an **embedded wall** (storefront) facing the room, whose opening is not sized
  here - that one makes the deductions incomplete.
- **Named, never zero**: `unplaced`, `not_enclosed`, `redundant` (its point lies inside another
  enclosed room of the same phase), `other_phase`, `other_level` (for explicit ids),
  `geometry_failed`. A face whose boundary info or subface area could not be read goes to a row
  under `(bounding element not read)` and to `face_read_failures`. `coverage.areas_complete` is
  false on any of them or on an unreadable bounding element or material;
  `coverage.deductions_complete` is false on an unsized or unattributed opening, an embedded wall
  facing the room, an insert whose phase could not be read, or a **linked wall** (its openings are
  not read). `coverage.complete` needs both.
- **Links**: a room bounded by a linked element gets that face's area (it is the room's own
  geometry) and the element's type, material and code read from the link document; if the link is
  not loaded only the area is read. Openings hosted in a **linked** wall are not read - their
  From/To room answers the link's rooms, not this document's - and each such bound is listed in
  `linked_bounding_elements` with what was and was not read (`hosted_openings_not_read` is true
  for a linked wall or a link that is not loaded, and makes the deductions incomplete).

## horizun_quantities - mode carbon

Volume, area and mass per material, multiplied by **your** factor table. Nothing is compiled in.

```json
{ "mode": "carbon", "category": "OST_Walls", "code_parameter": "Assembly Code",
  "factor_source": "Project EPD list rev B",
  "carbon_factors": [ { "material": "Concrete, Cast-in-Place gray", "factor": 240, "per": "m3" },
                      { "material_class": "Metal", "factor": 1.55, "per": "kg" } ] }
```

- Readings are `Element.GetMaterialIds(false)` x `GetMaterialVolume` / `GetMaterialArea`; density
  is the material's `StructuralAsset.Density` (kg/m3) when it has one.
- A factor names exactly one of `material` or `material_class`; name matches first, then class,
  case-insensitive. A repeated key is refused (the total would depend on order). Negative factors
  are accepted: EPDs declare biogenic carbon negative.
- `per: "m3"` multiplies the volume; `per: "kg"` multiplies volume x density.
- Rows are flat - material x code x level x `phase_created` x `phase_demolished` with `volume_m3`, `area_m2`, `mass_kg`, `kgco2e` and the
  counts `readings / counted / no_factor / no_density / unreadable_volume` - ready for
  `horizun_power_bi_push`. `kgco2e` sums **only** counted readings; `materials_without_factor`,
  `materials_without_density`, `unreadable_volumes` and `elements_without_materials` name the rest.
  Host document only; linked models are not read. A failed `GetMaterialArea` is named in
  `unreadable_areas` and counted per row (`unreadable_area`, `area_complete: false`).
- Carbon does NOT filter by phase or level: a category sweep reads every phase, demolished
  elements too, so `phase_created` and `phase_demolished` are grouping columns - filter them.
  A repeated id is read once and listed in `duplicate_ids`.

A key that another mode reads is **refused, not ignored**, in a mode that does not read it -
the reply names the key and the modes that read it, and nothing is measured. `carbon` refuses
`phase`, `level`, `quantities`, `classification_parameter`, `include_links`, `detail_level`,
`tolerance_pct` and `only_disagreements`; `room_finishes` refuses the same takeoff/volume keys
plus `category`, `carbon_factors` and `factor_source`; `takeoff` refuses `level`,
`carbon_factors` and `factor_source` (and `phase` without `group_by: "room"`). Without the
refusal, "the carbon of phase X" would silently come back as the carbon of every phase.

### Room membership: `horizun_query_model` include_room and takeoff group_by='room'

`horizun_query_model` with `include_room: true, phase: "<name>"` adds `room` to every row
(`state` assigned | unassigned | unlocatable, `room` and `space` as `{id, number, name, level}`,
the sampling `basis` and the `sample_point` in the query's coordinate units) and a
`room_membership` block with the counts. `horizun_quantities` mode `takeoff` with
`group_by: "room", phase: "<name>"` adds `room` to every row and a `by_room` rollup beside
`by_code`, keyed by room id, with the keys `(unassigned)` and `(unlocatable)` for the rest.
Both refuse `phase` without the option that reads it, and query_model refuses include_room
with `group_by` or `response_mode: "summary"` (there are no rows to carry it).

Sampling: point elements at the family's room calculation point, else the location point +1 mm
(and -1 mm for a ceiling-hosted instance the lift left in no room: basis `location_point_below`);
curves at start, middle and end (`curve_points`); floors at up to 32 points on their top face
(+1 mm); walls at an interior point of their solid (the centroid when inside, else the middle of
the wall piece a vertical line through it crosses - a centred door leaves only its header there).
Samples in two or more **different** rooms give `spans_rooms`: the row lists the rooms and
by_room keys the element under `(multiple rooms)` - never billed whole to one room. A miss beside
a hit is ignored (a slab's points under its own walls are in no room).

The two rules, written:

1. **The phase is mandatory.** Rooms and spaces exist per phase. There is no default: the
   last phase would silently answer for a different building. It is the HOST's phase.
2. **A linked element is placed in the HOST's rooms.** Its sample point goes through its
   own `RevitLinkInstance.GetTotalTransform()` and the host answers
   `Document.GetRoomAtPoint(point, phase)` / `GetSpaceAtPoint(point, phase)`. Whether the
   link is room-bounding does not change that query; it only shapes the host's rooms (a
   host room that needs the link's walls to close is not enclosed without them and holds
   nothing, so those elements come back unassigned). Rooms INSIDE a linked model are not
   read.

Sampling, one point per element:

| Element | Sample | Why |
|---|---|---|
| point-based (LocationPoint) | the point, lifted 1 mm | an element standing on its level is not lost on the room's bottom boundary |
| curve-based (LocationCurve) | the curve's midpoint | |
| wall | its largest solid's centroid, used only when a vertical line through it proves it lies inside the wall | a curved wall's centroid can fall outside it, into the room it bounds; that wall is unlocatable, not guessed |
| floor | a point ON its top face (one triangle's centroid), lifted 1 mm | a floor's body sits below the room it carries |

Consequences, by design: a room-bounding wall's centroid lies outside every room computed
at the wall finish, so **a wall that separates rooms is unassigned** (it belongs to none).
`room_membership.room_boundary_location` reports the document's room computation; when it
is not `Finish`, a `boundary_warning` says that a bounding wall's centroid can sit ON a
room boundary. Doors and windows sit inside their host wall, so their location point is
unassigned too; their sides are read with From/To room by `room_finishes`. An element with
no sample (a curtain wall, a ceiling, an element without location) is `unlocatable`, never
counted as unassigned. A floor whose top face lies below its room's base (a structural slab
under a finish floor) is unassigned.

## horizun_manage_views: `set_crop` (what makes a crop real)

`set_crop` writes the rectangle `box` (view plane, the call's units) and turns the crop
on. Its verdict no longer rests on the stored CropBox alone, which Revit keeps whether or
not it governs the view (reported: `verified: true` while the placed view still looked
uncropped). It now needs, before the commit and again after it: `CropBoxActive` true, the
"Crop View" parameter (`VIEWER_CROP_REGION`) on, read independently, the CropBox equal to
the request within 1 mm, and the crop SHAPE Revit draws (`GetCropShape`, projected on the
view plane) spanning the request. An unreadable shape is a note in `crop.notes`, not a
pass of its own. Refused by name before anything is written: a view template that controls
the crop (clear it with `set_template_controls` or remove the template), a scope box
driving it, and a sketched (non-rectangular) crop, over which the API ignores a crop box.
The row's `crop` block reports the facts, the crop's corners in model coordinates, and every
viewport showing the view with its size on the sheet against the crop at the view's scale;
a viewport larger than its crop is a named finding (`viewport_larger_than_crop`, usually
grids, levels or tags outside the crop while the annotation crop is off -
`set_annotation_crop`), reported without changing the verdict.

## horizun_manage_views: `renumber_sheets` (a register-wide map)

`renumber_sheets` renumbers many sheets at once from a map `old number -> new
number`, as ONE action inside the batch's single transaction:

```json
{ "operation": "renumber_sheets",
  "renumber": { "A101": "A102", "A102": "A101", "A103": "A110" } }
```

- **Collisions are refused before anything is written, all at once**: an old
  number no sheet holds, an old number named twice, two sheets sent to the same
  number, a new number held by a sheet the map does NOT move (checked against
  EVERY sheet, placeholders included), and a number another action of the same
  batch creates. Numbers compare case-insensitively, like the create operations.
- **Swaps and cycles are allowed.** Revit refuses a number another sheet still
  holds at the moment of assignment, so the steps are ordered: a sheet moves
  straight to its target as soon as it is free, and each closed cycle parks ONE
  sheet on a temporary `HZTMP-n` number that no sheet or target holds. A swap
  costs one extra step; a shifted series (`A101->A102->A103->A104`) costs none.
- **The rehearsal shows the plan**: `plan[i].renumber` lists `final` (sheet id,
  from, to), the ordered `steps` with `temporary` flags, `temporary_steps` and
  `unchanged` (entries whose new number equals the old one exactly).
- **The token binds the whole register** (every sheet's UniqueId and number):
  a sheet renumbered by anyone between rehearsal and apply refuses as stale.
- **After the commit every sheet is re-read**: `rows[i].renumber.renumbered[]`
  carries `reread` and `verified` per sheet; a single mismatch fails the action
  and the batch rolls back before commit.
- One `renumber_sheets` per batch (merge the maps). Its targets are reserved for
  the rest of the batch; the numbers it frees are NOT offered to a later
  `create_sheet` in the same batch, which checks the document as it was.
- Why not `horizun_fix_planimetry set_sheet_number`: that one corrects a cited
  finding and refuses a number another sheet holds, which a swap needs.

## horizun_manage_views: `create_perspective` (a camera, or a fan of them)

`create_perspective` creates a perspective 3D view from an eye (`start`), a target
(`end`), both in the batch `units`, and an optional `up` DIRECTION (unitless,
default world Z). `fan: N` (1..36) creates N views from the same eye, turned about
world Z in steps of 360/N starting at the target's azimuth and keeping the pitch of
eye -> target:

```json
{ "operation": "create_perspective", "key": "cam", "name": "Entrance",
  "start": [0, -8000, 1600], "end": [0, 0, 1600], "fan": 4 }
```

- **Nothing is nudged.** An eye closer than 1 mm to its target, an `up` parallel
  to the line of sight, and a camera looking straight up or down without an
  explicit `up` (or with `fan` > 1, which needs an azimuth) are refused in the
  rehearsal, by name.
- `up` is made perpendicular to the line of sight before it is sent (Revit refuses
  one that is not); the triple ACTUALLY sent is what is reported and re-read.
- **Names**: with `name` and no fan the view takes it; with a fan each view is
  `<name> azNNN` (whole-degree azimuth, counter-clockwise from +X). A name another
  3D view already holds is refused in the rehearsal. Without `name` Revit names them.
- **The rehearsal lists every camera**: `plan[i].perspective.views_to_create` and
  `cameras[]` (name, azimuth_degrees, pitch_degrees, eye_internal_feet, forward, up).
- **After the commit each view is re-read**: `rows[i].perspective.views[]` carries
  `view_id`, the camera sent, `reread` (GetOrientation's eye/forward/up, the name,
  IsPerspective), `orientation_verified` (eye within 1e-6 ft, directions within
  1e-4 degrees) and `verified`. One view that does not re-read fails the action and
  the batch rolls back before commit.
- `key` aliases the FIRST view of a fan. `view_scale` is refused: a perspective has
  no drawing scale. `view_family_type_id` must be a 3D view type.

## horizun_manage_views: `set_sun_study` (a view's sun: still, single-day, multi-day)

`set_sun_study` writes the `SunAndShadowSettings` of an existing view (`view_id`, or
`view_key` for a view created earlier in the batch):

```json
{ "operation": "set_sun_study", "view_id": 123456,
  "sun": { "type": "single_day", "start": "2026-06-21T07:00:00-05:00",
           "end": "2026-06-21T18:00:00-05:00" } }
```

- `sun.type`: `still` (one instant: `start`), `single_day` (start and end, at most
  24 h apart) or `multi_day` (start and end). Revit's `Lighting` type is not offered.
- **Instants carry their offset** (`Z` or `+hh:mm`). One without it is refused in the
  rehearsal: Revit rejects an unspecified kind, and picking a time zone for the
  caller would move the sun by hours. Each instant is sent as the UTC it names; Revit
  shows it in the site's own time zone.
- An `end` on a `still` sun is refused (Revit would store and ignore it). A study
  clears `SunriseToSunset` when it is on, because Revit ignores the given times while
  it is set; the row says so (`sunrise_to_sunset_cleared`).
- **`sun.lat` / `sun.lon` (degrees, both or neither) move the PROJECT site**, not the
  view: `SunAndShadowSettings.Latitude/Longitude` are read-only (MEASURED 2026-09-26 by
  reflection over the 2023 RevitAPI.dll: `CanWrite=False`), so the only writable place
  is the `SiteLocation` of the project location the settings use. Every view's sun
  moves, and Revit re-derives the place name, time zone and weather station from the
  coordinates. The rehearsal says so (`location_scope: "project_site"`,
  `location_side_effects`).
- **The rehearsal** (`plan[i].sun`) shows `requested` (type, `start_utc`, `end_utc`,
  site degrees), `location_scope` and, for an existing view, `current` (the settings'
  type, instants, `sunrise_to_sunset`, `shares_settings`, and the site's degrees, time
  zone and place name). `shares_settings: true` means other views share these settings
  and change with them. The token binds the current type, instants and site
  coordinates: a change made between rehearsal and apply refuses it as stale.
- **After the commit** `rows[i].sun` carries `before`, `reread` (same fields as
  `current`) and `checks`: the type, each instant within 1 minute of the one sent, and,
  when moved, the site's latitude/longitude within 1e-7 rad. The settings' own
  `settings_latitude_raw`/`settings_longitude_raw` are reported and NOT judged: their
  unit is not documented. A sun that does not re-read fails the action.
- Not measured live yet: whether a view template that controls the view's graphic
  display options overrides a sun written here; `before`/`reread` expose the
  per-view element either way.

## horizun_write_params_verified: `sequence` (values numbered in spatial order)

`sequence` is a third source for the batch, beside `writes` and `tabular_source` (give
exactly one): instead of listing the writes, the command GENERATES one write per target,
numbering the targets in a declared spatial order - door, window and room marks, or any
text parameter.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `parameter` | Required. Resolved on every target exactly like a `writes` entry (BuiltInParameter name, shared-parameter GUID or name): `ALL_MODEL_MARK` for doors and windows, `ROOM_NUMBER` for rooms. Values are written as text. |
| `element_ids` / `category` | Exactly one. Ids must be instance elements of the document. A `category` (OST_ name) sweeps every instance of it; an unplaced room, area or space has no position and is excluded, listed by id in `excluded_unplaced`. At most 5000 targets. |
| `order_by` | Required: keys applied left to right from `level`, `x`, `y`, `room`. `level` sorts by elevation, then name. `x`/`y` are the location point (a curve's midpoint) in internal coordinates, quantised to 1 mm so a rounding difference cannot swap two targets between rehearsal and apply. `room` is the room number compared naturally ("2" before "10"). The element id breaks the last tie, so one model always yields one order. |
| `phase_id` | Required with `room`: a room exists in a phase, and the same point can stand in one room in one phase and in another (or none) in the next. |
| `prefix`, `start` (1), `step` (1), `pad` (0 = none, at most 12) | Value = prefix + counter, zero-padded to `pad` digits. |
| `restart_per_level` | The counter returns to `start` on every level. Requires `level` as the FIRST key (each level's targets must be contiguous); values that then repeat across levels set `repeats_across_levels` - Revit may warn about duplicate marks. |

**The room of a target** (at the phase): a door or window takes `ToRoom`, then `FromRoom`
(the usual door-numbering rule: the room it opens into); another family instance its
`Room`; anything else the room at its location point, retried 1 ft (304.8 mm) higher
because an insertion point on the floor plane lies on the room's lower boundary. Each
target reports `room_from` (`to_room`, `from_room`, `room`, `point`, `point_raised_1ft`).

**Refused before anything is generated** (nothing written): an unknown field; no
`parameter`; neither or both of `element_ids`/`category`; a `category` that is not one
exact `OST_` name (numbers and comma lists are refused); a `category` sweep without
`phase_id`; a `phase_id` that is not a phase of the document; `room` without `phase_id`;
a second source beside `sequence` (`writes` or `tabular_source`); `restart_per_level` without `level` first; and
a target without the datum its order needs (no level - its own or its host's -, no
readable location, not inside a room at the phase), named by id and never sorted to an end.

**Rehearsal and apply.** The reply's `sequence` block lists `order[]` (position, target_id,
value, level, x_mm, y_mm, room, room_from, design_option, phase_status; the first 500)
beside the ordinary `rows`. A `category` sweep numbers only what exists at `phase_id` (New
or Existing, unphased, or a room/space OF that phase) and nothing in a secondary design
option; the rest is listed by id in `excluded_other_phase` / `excluded_secondary_option`
(unplaced rooms in `excluded_unplaced`). The token binds the options (request hash) AND
every generated VALUE (resolved plan): a change between rehearsal and apply that alters any
value (order, membership, room) is refused as stale, while a move that leaves every value
as it was applies exactly what was rehearsed. After the commit every row is re-read exactly
as for `writes`.

```json
{ "target_document": "Tower", "sequence": { "parameter": "ALL_MODEL_MARK", "category": "OST_Doors",
  "order_by": ["level", "room", "x"], "phase_id": 12345, "prefix": "D-", "pad": 3, "restart_per_level": true } }
```

Live probes: `scripts/live-probes/params-sequence.probes.ps1` (own levels, walls and room at
X = 1,120,000 mm; offline fakes in `params-sequence.tests.ps1`).

### Resumen (español)

`sequence` genera las escrituras en vez de listarlas: numera los objetivos (`element_ids` o
una `category`) en el orden declarado por `order_by` (nivel, x, y, habitación; la habitación
exige `phase_id`, y también un barrido por `category`, que solo numera lo que existe en esa
fase y nada de opciones de diseño secundarias), con `prefix`, `start`, `step`, `pad` y
`restart_per_level` (que exige el nivel como primera clave). Un objetivo sin el dato que su orden necesita se nombra y la
generación entera se rechaza. Los valores se muestran en el ensayo, el token los ata y cada
uno se relee tras el commit.

## MEP and structural analysis reads (read-only)

Three reads of numbers Revit already holds. None of them calculates anything,
and none of them carries a limit, factor or standard of its own: limits and
tolerances are arguments.

### horizun_plan_mep operation=system_analysis

Reads the critical path of duct (`MechanicalSystem`) and pipe (`PipingSystem`)
systems as Revit computed it: `MEPSystem.GetCriticalPathSectionNumbers()` in flow
order, then per `MEPSection` the flow (l/s), velocity (m/s), total pressure loss
(Pa), friction (Pa/m) and curve length (mm), all through `UnitUtils`.

- **Scope**: `element_ids` are system ids (anything else is refused by name).
  Without them, `kind` (`pipe`/`duct`, omitted = both) and `classification`
  (ONE exact `MEPSystemClassification` name such as `SupplyAir`,
  `DomesticColdWater`; comma lists and numbers are refused, because
  `Enum.TryParse` would OR `SupplyAir,ReturnAir` into `ExhaustAir`) select every
  matching system. More than 100 systems per call is refused, and so is an
  empty `element_ids` (omit it to read every system) - an empty selection is
  never widened to the whole model.
- **Limits**: `limits = { max_velocity_m_s, max_pressure_loss_pa,
  max_friction_pa_per_m }`. An unknown key is refused, not ignored. Sections
  beyond a limit are listed under `beyond_limits` with up to 50 element ids.
- **The calculation level decides what may be judged.** `None`, `Performance`
  and `Volume` are `not_calculated`: the section numbers are NOT read, because
  they read as zero and would pass any limit, and the system's coverage word is
  `unreadable` - so a call mixing judged and unjudged systems is `partial`,
  never the whole truth. `Flow` claims flow only (the API: "System calculation
  is only for flow"): velocity, pressure and friction limits on such a system
  are listed in `unmeasured_limits` until a live run proves Revit fills them.
  Only `All` claims all four. A claimed quantity that comes back null is named
  in `unread_quantities` (and makes the row `partial`) even with no limits.
- **Connectivity is read second.** RevitAPI.xml (2023 and 2026) on
  `IsWellConnected`: "If the system is not well connected, parameters which
  need to be calculated are invalid." Invalid, not understated - so a system
  with `is_well_connected` false (`not_well_connected`) or unreadable
  (`connectivity_unreadable`) is neither read nor judged: no critical path (it
  is the path of greatest pressure loss, chosen from those values), no pass and
  no breach, every limit listed in `unmeasured_limits`, and the row is
  `unreadable`.
- **Verdicts per system**: `beyond_limits`, `within_limits` (every limit measured
  on every critical-path section), `limits_partly_unmeasured` (not a pass),
  `no_limits_given` (its meaning says on how many critical-path sections the
  numbers were read), `not_well_connected`, `connectivity_unreadable`,
  `not_calculated`, `unreadable`, `no_critical_path` (a calculated, well-connected
  system with no base equipment) and `critical_path_unreadable` (the path would
  not read, or none of its sections did). None of them is "ok".
- **Coverage per system**: each row carries its `coverage` word and
  `coverage_reason` - its own cause (`flow_only`, sections or quantities that
  would not read, unmeasured limits, `not_calculated`, `not_well_connected`...),
  null when complete. The call's coverage reasons repeat that cause per system.
- `critical_path_pressure_loss_pa` is the sum of the critical-path section losses,
  published only when every one of them was read; null on a system nothing was
  read from.

### horizun_query_structure mode=analytical

Revit 2023+ analytical model: every `AnalyticalMember` and `AnalyticalPanel`
(paged with `offset`/`max_rows`, narrowed by `element_ids`).

- **Association** with the physical model through
  `AnalyticalToPhysicalAssociationManager`. Revit 2023 has only the singular
  `GetAssociatedElementId`; 2024+ reads the one-to-many
  `GetAssociatedElementIds`. `association` is `associated`, `none` or
  `unreadable`.
- **Members**: start/end (mm), length, section type, cross-section rotation,
  and releases per end: `GetReleaseType(start)` plus the six
  `ReleaseConditions` flags, published raw: the API does not state whether
  `true` is released or fixed, so no polarity is claimed (`flags_polarity`)
  until a live read of a Pinned member fixes it.
- **Member ends**: an end is CONNECTED when another analytical element reaches
  it within `tolerance_mm`: a member's REAL curve (`Curve.Distance` - a curved
  member is not judged on Revit's display tessellation, whose chords sag
  millimetres), an `AnalyticalLink`, a panel edge, or a panel SURFACE (inside
  its outer contour and outside its openings: a flat-slab column top is
  connected). An end only a `BoundaryConditions` element (point, line or area)
  holds is SUPPORTED: listed in `supported_ends`, counted in
  `member_ends_supported`, not a gap. The rest are `node_gaps`, counted in
  `member_ends_beyond_tolerance`: near-misses AND intended free ends such as
  cantilever tips, which this read does not tell apart - `nearest_mm` and
  `nearest_element_id` do. Default tolerance: Revit's own `VertexTolerance`,
  reported as `tolerance_source`. Every analytical element of the model is a
  target, whatever the page shows. Above 50,000,000 end x segment checks the
  check is NOT run and says so (`node_gaps_measured: false`). A member or panel
  whose curve would not read is named in a `node_gaps` coverage reason for the
  whole call, whatever page it is on (its ends were not checked, and an end
  framing into it may be counted as a gap); its own row has `node_gaps` and
  `supported_ends` null with `node_gaps` in `unread` - never an empty list.
- **Physical without analytical**: structural framing, structural columns,
  structural foundations (family instances, wall foundations and foundation
  slabs, which need no structural flag) and `Wall`/`Floor` elements flagged
  structural whose `HasAssociation` is false (up to 200 ids listed, with the
  full count). The category decides before the class: an in-place or loadable
  wall/floor family is a `FamilyInstance` in walls or floors and carries no flag
  this check reads, so - like any other class in those categories - it is
  counted in `excluded_other_classes`, named in a coverage reason, and makes the
  block `partial`: it was not checked, and it is never reported as a gap. With
  `element_ids` the block covers only the named ids (`scope` says so); when none
  of them is a physical element of these categories it is `not_applicable` with
  `count` null - nothing was checked.
- Each row carries `unread` - every field that would not read is named there
  (an end with no `ReleaseConditions` is `releases.start` / `releases.end`),
  never left a silent null - and its own `coverage` word.

### horizun_query_structure mode=loads

Point, line and area loads with load case (id, name, number), nature, category,
reaction flag, host and orientation. Magnitudes through `UnitUtils`: point force
kN, point moment kN*m, line force kN/m, line moment kN*m/m, area force kN/m2,
area m2, positions mm. `counts` per kind and `by_load_case` count every load in
scope, not only the page. Nothing is judged. Force and moment components are in
the load's own frame, `vector_frame` (`project`, `work_plane` or `host_local`,
from `OrientTo`): only `project` components are project coordinates and add up
with each other. A field that throws is named in `unread`; `host_id` null with
nothing unread means the load is not hosted. A load with NO load case (an invalid
`LoadCaseId` - an API-created load in a document with no case) reads
`load_case.assigned: false` with name, nature and category null by design, not
unread, and is counted under `by_load_case["(no load case)"]`; a case name that
cannot be read groups under `"(unreadable)"`. No group key is ever empty: Revit
names such a load's case "" and a JSON property named "" makes PowerShell's
`ConvertFrom-Json` refuse the whole reply (MEASURED 2026-09-27).

### horizun_code_check - operation=energy_readiness

Read-only in effect: Revit's energy analytical model is built from rooms/spaces
(SpatialElement, tier Final, read back as `energy_model.tier` - the same build `horizun_export
format=gbxml` uses) inside a transaction that is always rolled back; `energy_model.rolled_back`
is the rollback's own status, read back. Only rooms/spaces of the energy settings' export
category and `ProjectPhase` are judged; others are counted as `out_of_energy_phase`.

```json
{ "operation": "energy_readiness", "max_findings": 200 }
```

The reply has `spaces` (rooms and MEP spaces placed but not enclosed - zero area,
which Revit reports alike for not-enclosed and redundant ones - and enclosed ones
the energy model did not turn into an analytical space, matched by
CADObjectUniqueId, or reported unavailable when nothing resolves, and listed as
`possibly_not_in_energy_model` - not counted as findings - when some analytical spaces resolve
to no element), `surfaces`
(analytical surfaces by gbXML type and those whose `GetConstruction()` is null;
SurfaceAir and Shade are not asked; in Revit 2023 constructions are reported not
measurable, because the API exists from 2024, and so they are whenever the model's tier
reads back below Final) and `window_to_wall` (window and door
area over gross exterior-wall area in four 90-degree sectors centred on N/E/S/W,
azimuth from the wall's outward normal after `TransformModel`; `energy_model.azimuth_basis`
says `true_north` only when one exterior wall's normal was seen to turn by the project angle
(or the angle is 0), `project_north` when it did not turn or TransformModel threw, else
`unverified`; a sector
with no wall has `wwr: null`). The counts are measurements; nothing is called
compliant.

### horizun_code_check - operation=headroom

Read-only. Measures the clear height under (`direction: "down"`, the default) or over (`"up"`)
elements with vertical rays (`ReferenceIntersector`) cast in **your** 3D view, over the host
document and loaded Revit links - the ray and link handling of the hanger rods.

```json
{ "operation": "headroom",
  "headroom": { "view_id": 123456, "categories": ["OST_DuctCurves", "OST_StructuralFraming"],
                "min_mm": 2100, "direction": "down", "spacing_mm": 1000 } }
```

- `view_id` (required): a `View3D` that is not a template, has no active section box, is at **Fine**
  detail (below it pipes, fittings, conduit and tray are single lines with no faces), has no
  temporary hide/isolate, and hides - itself or through its template - no target or source category
  and has no enabled filter that hides elements. Each is refused by name: the intersector never
  returns what a view hides. Source elements hidden one by one are skipped with the reason; hidden
  worksets, links and single target elements are not read and are not surfaces here.
- `element_ids` **or** `categories`, exactly one. By category, the elements are the ones the view
  shows. Views, types, link instances and non-model elements are skipped with the reason, and so are
  vertical curves (risers, columns).
- `min_mm` (required): the clear height each measured sample is judged against.
- `spacing_mm` (default 1000, at least 100): samples sit at the middle of equal pieces of the location
  curve, else at the cell centres of a grid over the bounding box; at most 400 per element (the
  spacing grows and `spacing_used_mm` says so). At most 2000 elements and 5000 rays per call, counted
  before the first ray; above that the call is refused - raise the spacing or name fewer elements.
- `targets` (optional): the categories a ray may stop at. Defaults - down: floors, stairs, ramps,
  roofs, structural foundations, topography (and toposolids from 2024); up: floors, ceilings, roofs,
  stairs, structural framing, ducts, pipes, cable trays and conduits with their fittings and
  accessories, flex ducts and pipes, mechanical equipment, lighting fixtures, sprinklers. Stairs
  always bring stair runs and landings, which hold a component stair's faces.

Each ray starts 3 m beyond the element's bounding box - so a slab or screed the element is embedded in
is entered, and the sample reads `inside_target` - and crosses the element: the clear height runs
from the element's far face to the first target surface beyond it (a touching surface is 0). A sample
whose ray never crosses the element is `off_element` and not judged; one that crosses it and finds no
target beyond, or finds the element inside a target, is **not measured - never a pass**.

Per element, worst first (`max_findings` caps them, `elements_omitted` counts the rest): `outcome` -
`fails` (a measured sample below `min_mm`, whatever else was not measured), `not_measured` (nothing
measured, with the reason), `not_decidable` (every measured sample passes but some were not
measured), `passes` (every sample on the element measured at or above `min_mm`); `min_clear_mm`;
`coverage` (measured / samples on the element); `governing` (the far-face point in mm and the surface:
host or linked element id, link instance id, category).

Live probe: `scripts/live-probes/headroom.probes.ps1`. Not measured yet: rays against linked
surfaces, and a perspective view.

### `horizun_create_elements` — `placement: "all_enclosed"` (rooms and spaces)

An entry `{kind: room|space, placement: "all_enclosed", level_id, phase_id,
min_area_m2?}` (no `point`, no `name`/`number`) is expanded on every call into one
row per closed region of the level in that phase that holds no room/space yet and
is not under `min_area_m2` (shafts, chases). The phase is required, never guessed.
all_enclosed entries go in a batch of their own: the regions are read before anything
in the batch is built (walls or separators created in the same request would not be
seen), and the expanded rows would renumber the caller's other entries. The level
needs a floor plan (`no_floor_plan` otherwise): `NewRoom(Room, PlanCircuit)` throws
for a level without a view, and space regions are found through one.

ROOMS: the regions are Revit's `PlanTopology(level, phase)` circuits, each listed
with `area_m2`, `sides`, `is_room_located` and `point_inside` (Revit's own interior
point: PlanCircuit exposes no centroid). A room goes in with `NewRoom(Phase)` +
`NewRoom(Room, PlanCircuit)` in the circuit re-read at apply time (a wall moved since
the rehearsal refuses as `enclosed_circuit_gone` or as a stale token) - per circuit
rather than `NewRooms2`, which fills every circuit and could honour `min_area_m2` only
by creating and deleting. SPACES: space regions are bounded by space separators, not
room separators, so they are the regions Revit's own `NewSpaces2(level, phase, floor
plan)` fills, read in a transaction that is always rolled back; each is placed with
`NewSpace(Level, Phase, UV)` at the point Revit chose, and the spaces already standing
on the level in that phase are listed as `skipped_has_space`. Whether `NewSpaces2`
throws or answers empty when every region is filled is not measured; its message, if
any, is kept in `revit_said`. Reading the topology needs a modifiable document (Revit
computes it on first access), so the rehearsal reads it in the same rolled-back way.

Each region's `action` is `create`, `skipped_has_room|space`, `skipped_min_area`,
`skipped_zero_area` (Revit gives the region no area - a second `NewSpaces2` over filled
regions posts zero-area, redundant spaces; MEASURED 2026-09-27) or `no_interior_point` (Revit
could not give one: listed and skipped, never aborting the batch). Plan rows and errors of expanded rows carry `elements_index`, the caller's own
entry. After the commit each row re-reads `area_positive`, `boundary_closed` (every
boundary loop closes), `phase_id` and the interior point (`point_inside_room`, or the
space's own point check). When nothing is left to fill, a rehearsal lists the regions
and writes nothing; an apply is refused as `stale_plan` (a token is only issued for a
plan that creates rows); a level and phase with no region at all is refused as
`no_enclosed_circuit` rather than read as "all filled". NOT PROVEN and NOT MEASURED:
whether Room Bounding walls of a LINKED model close a host region - the reply says so
in `link_bounding`; measuring it needs a linked model whose own walls enclose a region,
which the live probe does not stage.
`phase_id` and `min_area_m2` belong to the placement: beside a `point` they are refused by
name rather than accepted and ignored (a point room goes in with `NewRoom(Level, UV)`, in the
phase Revit gives it). The advertised room/space branches therefore require only `level_id`:
a row carries either a `point` or `placement: "all_enclosed"`.

### `horizun_create_elements` — `kind: "toposolid"` (Revit 2024+)

`{kind: "toposolid", level_id, type_id, points: [[x, y, z], ...]}` creates one toposolid with
`Toposolid.Create(doc, points, typeId, levelId)`: the points ARE its top surface, triangulated
by Revit. They are in the request's `units` and in ABSOLUTE internal coordinates - not shared or
survey coordinates; take surveyed or shared points into internal
coordinates first. Between 3 and 100 points (the `points` field is
the one the flex kinds use, and its `maxItems` is 100), all finite, one height per plan point
(two points closer than ~0.3 mm in plan are refused), not all on one plan line.

`type_id` is required - the type is never "the first one": a row without it is refused with
the document's toposolid types listed by name and id (copy one in with
`horizun_copy_between_documents` when there is none).

**Verified after the commit** by re-reading the solid, not the call that did not throw: at up
to 50 sampled input points (every point when there are fewer; the lowest and the highest
always, the rest evenly spread), each named `top_z_at_point_<i>` in the postconditions, the top
of the solid at that X,Y must stand at the point's Z within 1 mm. The height is read from the
solid's own vertices at that plan point and, when Revit merged the point into a flat face,
from a vertical line through its faces; an X,Y where neither finds the solid is unmeasured and
the row fails.

**Not measured yet**: whether Revit reads a point's Z as absolute or relative to the level.
Absolute is asserted; a Revit that reads it the other way fails the row (rolled back) instead
of passing. The live probe stages its level at 500 mm precisely so the two readings differ.

**Revit 2023** has no Toposolid (it arrived in 2024): the row is refused by name,
`toposolid_not_in_revit_2023`, and a TopographySurface - a different element - is not created
in its place.

**From a LandXML TIN**: `{kind: "toposolid", level_id, type_id, landxml_path}` in place of
`points` (exactly one of the two). The caller exports ONE TIN surface to LandXML and passes the
absolute path; `C:\...\site.xml#EG` picks surface `EG` of a file that holds several (a path that
exists as written is taken whole). Each `<P>` is read as `northing easting elevation` in the
file's declared `linearUnit` (heights in its `elevationUnit` when it declares one), and only the points a visible face uses are kept (a face marked
`i="1"` is invisible). Refused by name: no unit or an unknown one (linear or elevation), several surfaces and none
named, a grid surface, a point without an elevation, a face naming an undefined point, a DTD.
At most 20 000 used points and 64 MB per file (guards, not measured limits).

The file speaks SHARED coordinates, so its points are placed through the document's ACTIVE
project position - the formula `tabular_source` applies to shared rows: subtract the position's
east/west and north/south, rotate by minus its angle, subtract its elevation. The rehearsal's
`plan` row carries a `landxml` block (file, surface, `sha256`, unit, points in file / used /
unused, visible and invisible faces, the `project_position` used, `sampled_point_ids`), and the
token binds the hash, the surface and the position: a file edited or a survey point moved between
rehearsal and apply is refused as stale. Revit triangulates the points itself - the file's faces
choose which points are used, not how they join. The post-commit re-read proves the solid stands
at the CONVERTED points; it cannot prove the conversion, and its sign on a ROTATED project
position is not measured yet - check the printed position before applying.

**Live probe** (`scripts/live-probes/rooms-topo-federation.probes.ps1`, offline twin
`rooms-topo-federation.tests.ps1`, shapes from the code until the first live run). On its own
level at 71 000 mm, far from the model (X = 1 150 000 mm), it draws two bays with walls of
`Basic Wall: Generic - 200mm` brought by name from the year's `DefaultMetric.rte` (6 x 4 m and
2 x 4 m at the centrelines, sharing a wall) gives it its own floor plan and uses the document's last phase: the rehearsal
lists both circuits, `min_area_m2 = 10` marks the small one `skipped_min_area`, the apply
creates two verified rooms, a second call plans nothing (`skipped_has_room`), the space
rehearsal lists as many `NewSpaces2` regions as room circuits, the space apply creates a
verified space in each and a second call plans nothing (`skipped_has_space`), and
link-bounded regions stay `not_covered` with the reply's `not_proven` declaration - NOT
measured: the probe stages no linked model with walls of its own, and no region split only
by a space separator (the bridge has no typed space separator). The toposolid goes on a second own level at 500 mm from six
non-coplanar points (Z 1 000 to 4 000 mm) with the type `Toposolid: Toposolid` by name, or is
`not_covered` naming the types it saw; in 2023 the named refusal is the pass. Beside it
(X + 40 m) the same kind comes from a five-point LandXML TIN the probe writes: a first rehearsal
names the active project position, the file is rewritten through its inverse so the surface lands
at the probe's own X, and the case records the position it used (an identity one leaves the
rotated-position sign unexercised); in 2023 a `landxml_path` row must bring the same named
refusal. Everything is deleted with `horizun_delete_verified` `mode: "ids"`; nothing is saved.

## horizun_document_session — operation `new_project`

Creates a blank project from a template and saves it: `save_as_path` (required, an
absolute `.rvt` that must **not** exist) and `template_path` (optional `.rte`). Without
`template_path` it uses this Revit's own `Application.DefaultProjectTemplate` (Options >
File Locations, set per locale by the installer) and says so in `template_source`; when
none is configured, or it is not on disk, the call is refused and names where Autodesk's
templates usually live. A project with no template is never created in its place.

- **Never overwrites.** There is no `overwrite` for this operation; an existing file, or a
  path whose existence cannot be tested, is refused. A template from a newer Revit is
  refused; an older one is upgraded in memory only and the template file is never written.
- **Rehearses by default.** `dry_run` defaults to true (as for `sync_with_central`): the
  rehearsal reads both paths and the template header and returns a `confirmation_token`
  bound to the template (path, size, write time) and the target. Apply with the same
  arguments, `dry_run: false`, that token and a new `idempotency_key`.
- **Verified by re-reading.** `Application.NewProjectDocument(template)` then `SaveAs`
  with `OverwriteExistingFile = false`; afterwards the file must exist with a size and a
  header that reads this host's Revit year, and the document's `PathName` must be the
  requested path. Either check failing closes the document without saving and deletes the
  file this call wrote, so the path is empty again.
- **Activation is reported, not assumed.** The API activates a document only through
  `UIApplication.OpenAndActivateDocument`; the operation uses the same bare-path call as an
  `open` of an already-open document and re-reads the active document. `activated: false`
  (with `activation_note`) means the project is created, saved and open in the background.

Course dry run 2026-09-30 (defect #18): without this the run fell back to a copy of
another model plus a new level, which modified 172 unrelated elements. Live probe:
`scripts/live-probes/document-session-new-project.probes.ps1` (offline tests in its
`.tests.ps1`); not yet run in Revit.

## horizun_document_session — operation `sync_with_central`

Synchronizes a workshared **local** with its central: `target_document` (required),
`comment`, `relinquish` (`all` default | `keep_borrowed` | `none`), `compact`.

**Off by default, owner-gated like `horizun_execute_python`.** Only the machine owner
turns it on, inside Revit: *Horizun Hub tab > Advanced options > Synchronize with
central*. The choice is stored as `sync_with_central_owner_granted` in
`%USERPROFILE%\.horizun\settings.json`; no MCP call writes it and a malformed file reads
as OFF. *Protect shared models* (`force_read_only_on_workshared`) wins over the grant.
The typed operation also needs *What may the assistant do?* at the level that opens and
closes documents (`permission_profile` `full_write`): under the default `safe_write`
every document-session call is refused, so the grant alone does not make it reachable.
Both switches cover `horizun_execute_python` too, over the main script **and every
include** (they run in the same scope): a script whose masked source mentions
`SynchronizeWithCentral` - a call or a bare alias such as `s = doc.SynchronizeWithCentral`
- or the `SynchronizeNow` / `SynchronizeAndModifySettings` postable commands is refused
before it runs: `force_read_only_on_workshared` while shared models are protected,
whatever the grant says (a script reaches every open document through `app.Documents`),
and `sync_not_authorised` while the grant is OFF. That is a text scan, not a sandbox: a
name assembled at runtime (getattr with a built string) is not caught.
`RelinquishOwnership` is not covered: it is not a synchronize and has its own typed tool,
`horizun_relinquish_all`.

Refusals before anything runs (`write_started: false`) carry `detail.code`:
`not_workshared`, `workshared_state_unreadable`, `detached_copy`,
`detached_state_unreadable`, `force_read_only_on_workshared`, `sync_not_authorised`,
`document_read_only`, `local_file_read_only` (Document.IsReadOnlyFile: the call cannot
save a read-only local before or after synchronizing, and the API does not say at which
step it notices), `transaction_open` (Document.IsModifiable is true only inside an open
transaction, which the call refuses), `no_central_path`, `invalid_comment` (over the
30,000 characters SynchronizeWithCentralOptions.Comment accepts),
`ownership_census_incomplete`, `confirmation_rejected` and `sync_options_rejected`.

`sync_precondition_failed`: the call threw one of its documented InvalidOperation/Argument
preconditions. Not every one is placed before the central write, so the reply re-reads
first: `write_started: false` (`transaction_status: not_started`) only when ownership,
IsModified and a file-based central's write time prove nothing moved; `true` when
something measured moved; `null` (`transaction_status: unknown`) otherwise - a server
central, whose write time cannot be read, always lands here.

**The preview is an ESTIMATE, not a rehearsal** (`preview_kind: "estimate"`). A sync can
be neither rehearsed nor rolled back. An omitted `dry_run` is a preview (the operation's
schema variant publishes `dry_run` default `true`). It reports:

- `has_all_changes_from_central`: `Document.HasAllChangesFromCentral()`, which asks the
  central whether this local is up to date (`null` plus `has_all_changes_error` naming
  the exception when the central could not be asked, for example locked or unreachable);
- owned worksets, owned and borrowed elements (WorksharingUtils.GetCheckoutStatus over
  every collectable element; borrowed = owned while its workset is not) and
  `Document.IsModified`;
- a deterministic SAMPLE of `GetModelUpdatesStatus`: an even spread of 150 ids plus up to
  50 of the local's likely changes, borrowed elements first and then the newest owned ids
  (every element of an owned workset reads as owned, so the oldest owned ids are rarely
  changes).

Ownership and the sampled statuses are the session's **cached** view: the API documents
both as locally cached values that may not match the central. Only
`has_all_changes_from_central` asks the central.

**The token binds the request and the estimate.** Apply with `dry_run=false`, the
`confirmation_token` and an `idempotency_key`. The request (document, comment,
relinquish, compact) is the token's plan hash; the estimate (ownership counts,
IsModified, has_all_changes_from_central, sampled status counts) is its model
fingerprint. A different request is refused as such; a model that moved is refused as a
stale plan that names the fields that moved (`confirmation_rejected`): preview again.

**A locked central is not waited for.** Revit's default is to wait and retry endlessly.
This call sets a lock callback that gives up at once, so a locked central returns
`central_locked` (`write_started: true`, `changes_applied: null`: the local may have been
saved or reloaded before the lock was needed). Any other exception from the call is
`sync_failed_state_unknown`, with the re-read in the detail.

**After the sync** every element measured before is looked up again by **UniqueId**: the
API documents that an ElementId may change across a sync, so `element_id` values in the
report are for display. Ownership is re-counted and held against the choice (`all`:
nothing owned; `keep_borrowed`: no workset owned and exactly the previously borrowed,
still existing elements owned; `none`: worksets and owned elements unchanged). The same
sample is re-read, `HasAllChangesFromCentral()` - read FIRST, right after the call
returns - must read true, and a save must be witnessed:
`is_modified_after` false (SaveLocalAfter) or, for a file-based central,
`central_file_written` true (its write time advanced; Revit saves to central even with no
changes). `sync_verified` is true only when all of that holds, false whenever the call
threw or something measured contradicts THIS sync (ownership against the choice, a
sampled element still `NotYetInCentral`, no save witnessed), and null when something could
not be measured. `HasAllChangesFromCentral()` false and sampled elements reading
`UpdatedInCentral` / `DeletedInCentral` (listed in `update_status_sample.moved_in_central_since`)
describe the central as it is now - another user's sync after this one produces them - so
they leave `sync_verified` null, never false. With `relinquish=none`, elements the sync's
reload brought into a workset this user still owns read as owned; they are listed in
`ownership.arrived_in_owned_worksets` and not counted against the choice. A sync that returned but did not verify is reported as a failure with
`changes_applied: true`: it happened, and it did not verify. Revit's own Synchronize with
Central and other add-ins are not intercepted (see the prevention gate's
`not_interceptable` list).

## horizun_manage_links: acquire_coordinates, point clouds, IFC links, scan_deviation

**acquire_coordinates** (`link_instance_id` required: a loaded `RevitLinkInstance` or a
LINKED CAD `ImportInstance`). `Document.AcquireCoordinates` runs inside a transaction, so
the dry run is a REAL rehearsal: it acquires, re-reads and rolls back, and the reply
carries the rollback status. The token binds the host's shared position at the project
base point and the source instance. After the commit the checklist re-reads:

- RVT link: `link_same_site_delta_mm`, measured with the very method
  `horizun_federation_check` uses for `same_site` (three link points taken to shared
  coordinates through the link and through the host), must be <= 1 mm;
- CAD link: `cad_wcs_delta_mm` - three import points must sit at the DWG's own
  coordinates in the host's shared system (the WCS rule RevitAPI documents);
- `host_shared_position_changed` must be true.

The reply publishes `project_position_before` / `project_position_after` in mm and
degrees - the units `horizun_manage_units operation=base_points project_position` takes,
so a caller can restore. The token also binds where the source instance sits (its total
transform) and, for an RVT, the link's own same_site delta: a link moved or reloaded
between the dry run and the apply refuses as a changed plan. Refused by name before Revit
is asked: a link that already shares the host's site (delta <= 1 mm) and an unloaded link.
A type placed more than once is NOT pre-refused, because the instance is always named:
the rehearsal asks Revit, whose own answer ("Cannot acquire coordinates from a model
placed multiple times" per RevitAPI) is what the caller hears; the plan lists
`placements_of_type`. The API always overwrites the host's geolocation with the link's,
unlike the UI; the warning says so. `publish_coordinates` is a later step.

**add kind=point_cloud** (`.rcp` / `.rcs`; `kind` defaults from the extension).
`PointCloudType.Create` + `PointCloudInstance.Create` with the identity transform, inside a
transaction: the dry run is a real rehearsal with rollback. Refused by name when
`PointCloudEngineRegistry.GetSupportedEngines()` lacks the engine
(`point_cloud_engine_unavailable`) or the path is already linked (compared with each
`PointCloudType.GetPath()`: a point cloud is not an ExternalFileReference). Verified: type and
instance re-read, instance of that type, and an engine identifier Revit reports (published as
`engine` beside `engine_requested`; not compared with the extension: RevitAPI documents the
built-in engine's identifier as "pcg", and the value for .rcp/.rcs is still to be measured).

**add kind=ifc**. The importer's own Link branch, aimed at the host:
`Application.OpenIFCDocument(path, IFCImportOptions{Action=Open, Intent=Reference})`
imports the IFC by reference into a NEW document, which is saved as `<file>.ifc.RVT` and
closed; then `RevitLinkType.CreateFromIFC` + `RevitLinkInstance.Create` link it in the
host. (`Action=Link` is not used: with it the importer links the intermediate into the
document OpenIFCDocument returns, never into the host.) The dry run is a measured preview
(the import and the save happen outside any transaction); its token binds the path AND
the intermediate's state on disk (absent, or size and last write), so an `.ifc.RVT` that
appears or changes before the apply refuses as a changed plan. Failures are named by step:
`ifc_importer_unavailable` only when `Revit.IFC.Import` is neither loaded, nor beside
RevitAPI.dll, nor in an ApplicationPlugins IFC bundle built for the running year (its path names the
year; `importer_looked_in` says where) - refused by the dry run already, before a token;
`ifc_import_failed` (importer present, Revit refused the file); `intermediate_save_failed`;
`link_failed` (host transaction rolled back). None touches the host model, and each
reports `intermediate_before` / `intermediate_after` / `disk_changed`. Verified: type
Loaded, instance present and of that type, the linked model holds DirectShape elements
(`linked_direct_shapes` > 0, what a Reference import builds) and does not link to itself.
Instance type, DirectShapes and self-link are read before the commit, so a link failing them
is rolled back (`link_failed`); only an unreadable linked document leaves them to the re-read.

**scan_deviation** (read-only): `link_instance_id` names the `PointCloudInstance`,
`element_ids` (<= 200) the walls, floors and columns, `tolerance_mm` (default 10). For
each planar face (<= 60 per element) a convex slab - two planes at +/- band around the
face (band = max(3 x tolerance, 30 mm)) and four around its UV rectangle - is the
multi-plane filter for `GetPoints(filter, averageDistance, maxPoints = 5000)`, averageDistance
being the face's own (`average_distance_mm`): 20 mm, coarsened on a large face to
sqrt(area / (0.8 x 5000)) so a fully scanned face stays under the cap and what returns is the
whole face, never a subset the cap chose.
Points that project inside the face give signed distances; a face is `ok` when the 95th
percentile of |distance| is within tolerance, else `deviates`, and `not_measured` with
fewer than 20 points (`too_few_points`), or when its points occupy under `min_coverage_share`
(0.5) of the cells of a grid over the face (cells of 4 spacings, at most 24 per axis, counted
when their centre lies on the face; `low_coverage`, with `coverage_share` and `coverage_grid`
published; `coverage_undetermined` when no cell centre lies on it) - never `ok`. Coverage is
measured where the points are, not by counting them: a large face seen in one corner returns
as many points as a small face seen whole. The slab reaches `band_mm` outward but only
`band_inward_mm` = min(band, 0.4 x the thickness behind the face, from the element's
nearest antiparallel face) inward, so the element's own opposite face is never taken for
this face's deviation. Non-planar faces and faces beyond 60 per element count as
not_measured in the element's state and in `faces_not_measured`. The point frame (raw or
through the instance's total transform) is taken per face from where the points actually
fall inside the filter; a face where neither frame holds, or where both do (a transform
smaller than the band), is `not_measured`, `point_frame_undetermined`. A cloud whose file
is not found (`FoundStatus` NotFound) is refused, `cloud_not_found`; an element without
readable solids is `geometry_unreadable` / `no_solid_geometry`. The reply declares its
application outcome as not started (read-only). Elements: `ok` only when every face is ok,
`partially_measured`, `not_measured` or `deviates`; the verdict passes only when every
element is ok. Deviations beyond the band are not visible, and the reply says so.

Live probes: `scripts/live-probes/links-survey.probes.ps1`. Point-cloud cases read
`PointCloudPath` (and, for the positive scan, `PointCloudFloor`) from
`%USERPROFILE%\.horizun\live-fixtures.json` and are `not_covered`, named, without them.
The IFC case uses `IfcLinkSource` when given and otherwise exports its own IFC of the
write document, so every year is measured; a refusal passes only as
`ifc_importer_unavailable` AND with that year's `Revit.IFC.Import.dll` really absent.

## Sketch edits (`edit_sketch`) and the FIEBDC-3 budget export (`export_bc3`)

### `horizun_transform_elements` operation=`edit_sketch`

Changes the boundary of ONE Floor, Ceiling or Opening **without recreating it**. The edit
happens inside the element's own `SketchEditScope`, so the element keeps its ElementId and
its UniqueId, and everything that refers to it - hosted instances, tags, schedules,
parameter values - stays attached, where delete-and-recreate would orphan all of it.

Two modes, one per call. The operation is sent **alone** (like `realign_wall_sketch`): a
`SketchEditScope` cannot nest inside the single transaction the other operations share.

- **Replace a loop**: `loop` (the new points `[x,y,z]` in the request's `units`) and
  `loop_index` (which loop it replaces; the dry run lists them in `loops_before`, and every
  refusal that comes after the sketch was read carries them too). A
  closing point that repeats the first is dropped. The new loop is checked before Revit
  sees it: at least three vertices, no edge shorter than 1 mm, no two non-adjacent edges
  that touch or cross, some enclosed area.
- **Move a vertex**: `start` (the vertex as it is now, matched within 0.5 mm) and `end`
  (where it goes). Both curves that meet at the vertex must be lines: moving the end of an
  arc would redefine the arc, which is not guessed - replace the loop instead.

**The loop's own curves are kept wherever they can be.** A vertex move reshapes the two
lines that meet there. A loop replaced by one with the SAME number of straight edges
reshapes every existing line onto the new edge nearest to it (the rotation and direction
with the least total displacement), so what those curve elements carry - a line's Defines
Slope flag, dimensions and constraints drawn to it - stays on them (`method:
reshape_in_place`). Only a loop whose edge count changes, or that holds arcs, is deleted and
redrawn (`method: delete_and_redraw`), and that path refuses, by name and already in the
rehearsal, a loop line that defines the slope (the element would come back flat) and any
deletion that would take another element with it. The loop's curve elements are found
through each profile curve's `Reference.ElementId` - the mapping `Sketch.GetAllElements`
documents - cross-checked against their geometry, so a slope arrow drawn along an edge is
never taken for the edge. A full circle (one closed curve, no vertices) is carried and
verified but never edited; `fixed_loops` names it.

```json
{ "operations": [ { "operation": "edit_sketch", "element_ids": [412233], "loop_index": 0,
    "loop": [[0,0,3000],[5000,0,3000],[5000,4000,3000],[0,4000,3000]] } ], "units": "mm" }

{ "operations": [ { "operation": "edit_sketch", "element_ids": [412233],
    "start": [0,4000,3000], "end": [1000,4000,3000] } ], "units": "mm" }
```

Points must lie **on the sketch plane** (within 1 mm). They are refused, never projected, so
a wrong elevation is never silently flattened; the refusal names a point of the plane as
`(x, y, z) mm` in invariant-culture numbers, so a caller can re-send on it.

`dry_run` (the default) is a **real rehearsal** of the curve edits: they are made inside the
scope, which is then Cancelled. Revit checks the finished sketch as a whole only when the
apply commits the scope (a refusal there rolls the whole group back), so the plan first
refuses by name a loop with fewer than three vertices, an edge under 1 mm, a self-crossing,
or contact with another loop of the sketch, and any loop that would turn from hole to solid
or back (a hole the new boundary leaves outside would silently become slab, and the area
would still agree with the sketch). A vertex move on a loop that holds arcs is held on the
tessellated outline around the moved vertex. The plan reports `mode`, `method`,
`loop_index`, `vertex_index`, `sketch_plane` (`origin` in the request's units, `x_dir`,
`y_dir`, `normal`), `loops_before` / `loops_expected` (model `[x,y,z]` in the request's
units: a vertex can be sent back as `start` as it stands), `loops_before_mm` /
`loops_expected_mm` (`(u, v)` in mm from `sketch_plane.origin` along `x_dir` and `y_dir`),
`fixed_loops`, `hosted_elements`, `sketch_area_before_m2`, `expected_area_m2`,
`area_parameter_before_m2`, `area_check` (`will_verify` | `not_applicable`) and
`rehearsal_ok` / `rehearsal_error`. The confirmation token binds the element, the edit and
the units; none is usable while the rehearsal fails.

After the commit the model is re-read, and the row is `verified` only when:

- the same id still carries the same UniqueId (`unique_id_kept`);
- every hosted instance, opening and tag that depended on the element still exists
  (`hosted_check`, `hosted_elements_before` / `hosted_elements_kept`). This, and the loops,
  are also held BEFORE the transaction group is kept: a lost dependent, or a scope commit
  Revit rolled back without raising (the old loops still there), rolls the whole edit back
  and is reported with what Revit said at the commit (`revit_said_at_commit`), never as
  committed;
- the committed sketch's loops match the expected loops (`loops_verified`; cyclic, either
  direction, loop order free, 0.5 mm);
- the element's Area parameter equals the area the new sketch encloses within
  max(0.0005 m2, 0.1 %) (`area_check: verified`) - **but only where the Area equalled the
  old sketch's own area before the edit**. A sloped or shape-edited floor, or one a shaft
  or an opening cuts, reports an Area the sketch alone does not predict: there
  `area_check` is `not_applicable`, named with `area_note`, never counted as a pass, and
  the loops carry the verification.

Refused by name: a **FootPrintRoof** (the public API exposes no `SketchId` on any roof in
2023-2027; edit its footprint in Revit), a wall (`realign_wall_sketch` covers the
stranded-profile case), anything else. A group member, a part or an element borrowed by
somebody else answers `IsSketchEditingSupported = false` and is refused before anything
changes. The edit is not recorded by `horizun_undo`; use Revit's own undo in the session.

### `horizun_budget_compare` operation=`export_bc3`

Host-resident: no Revit API, the server writes the file. It turns a `horizun_quantities`
`mode='takeoff'` reply (`model_rows`, or `model_rows_path` to a saved reply) and **the
caller's own APU table** into a FIEBDC-3 (`.bc3`) budget. The quantity per code is chosen by
the same rules `operation=compare` uses (`mapping`: the code field, units, declared
conversions only, partial coverage refused unless opted into), so an exported line and a
compared line never disagree about what the model measured.

```json
{ "operation": "export_bc3", "model_rows_path": "C:\\work\\takeoff.json",
  "mapping": {},
  "apu": [ { "code": "E05.01", "unit": "m2", "unit_price": 100, "description": "Floor slab" },
           { "code": "E07.02", "unit": "m",  "unit_price": 25.5 } ],
  "bc3_path": "C:\\work\\budget.bc3" }
```

- `mapping`: the object `operation=compare` takes (`code_field`, `quantity_field`,
  `unit_conversions`); `{}` keeps its defaults.
- `apu`: `[{code, unit, unit_price, description?}]` - a finite price >= 0, one price per
  code. Nothing is compiled in: prices are always the caller's.
- `bc3_path`: absolute, ending in `.bc3`, in an existing folder; an existing file is never
  overwritten. Writing a file needs a profile that allows external side effects.
- `idempotency_key` (required): claimed in the durable ledger before the file is touched. A
  retry after a lost reply gets the recorded reply back (`replayed: true`) once the file it
  names is re-hashed on disk and still matches - nothing is written again; a file that is
  gone or changed refuses the retry, naming both hashes. A refusal after the claim (say,
  `bc3_path` already exists) is the recorded answer for that key: a new attempt takes a new key.

**All or nothing.** A takeoff code the APU does not price is refused - a price is never
invented - and so is a code whose quantity could not be established (the comparison's
reason is quoted). The refusal names every such code and nothing is written: a `.bc3`
missing lines is a smaller budget wearing the project's name. APU codes the takeoff does not
carry are listed in `apu_codes_unused`; elements without a classification code are counted
in `not_exported.unclassified_elements`, never priced.

What is written for a takeoff with one code (FIEBDC-3/2020, character set ANSI =
windows-1252, CRLF line ends):

```
~V||FIEBDC-3/2020\26092026|Horizun Revit MCP||ANSI||2|
~K|6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\\||6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\6\\|
~C|HZ_TAKEOFF##||Horizun takeoff|2000|26092026|0|
~C|E05.01|m2|Floor slab|100|26092026|0|
~D|HZ_TAKEOFF##|E05.01\1\20\|
~M|HZ_TAKEOFF##\E05.01|1\|20|\id 1234\12\\\\\id 1301\8\\\\|
```

- `~K`: every decimals slot - field 1 (DN DD DS DR DI DP DC DM) and the 2020 field 3 (DRC
  DC DFS DRS DUO DI DES DN DD DS DSP DEC) - set to 6, the precision the file is written
  with, so a reader applying the format's defaults (2 decimals for measurement units and
  totals, 3 for yields) does not round what was verified. DIVISA is left empty: the
  currency is the caller's to state.
- `~C`: one concept per code (unit, APU description as the summary, unit price, date, type
  0) plus the **root `HZ_TAKEOFF##`** - `##` is how FIEBDC marks the root concept, which is
  why codes may carry neither `#` (reserved for chapters and the root) nor whitespace - nor
  `%` or `&`: FIEBDC-3 reads a child code carrying either as a PERCENTAGE over the lines
  before it in the decomposition, so its quantity would be read as a percentage. The
  root's price is the budget total.
- `~D`: the root's decomposition - every code with factor 1 and its quantity as the yield.
- `~M`: one measurement record per code, `<root>\<code>`, its position, its total, and one
  line per **element**: `TYPE\COMMENT\UNITS\LENGTH\WIDTH\HEIGHT\` with the comment
  `id <element id>` (or `link <instance> id <element id>` for a linked element) and the
  element's quantity in the APU's unit as UNITS. The lines sum to the total, which equals
  the `~D` yield.
- **Precision**: every number is written rounded to 6 decimals with `.` as the decimal
  separator (invariant culture). The root total is computed from the WRITTEN quantities and
  prices, so the file's own arithmetic closes; the `~M` lines may differ from their total by
  at most 1e-6 per line, which the verifier allows and names rather than hides.

**Why some text is refused, not escaped.** FIEBDC-3 has no escape for its own separators:
`~` starts a record, `|` a field, `\` a subfield - a description carrying one becomes extra
records or fields in every reader. windows-1252 has no byte for most of Unicode (math
symbols, CJK, emoji). Control characters are refused too: a line break inside a field
splits the record for many readers. Rewriting any of these silently would produce a budget
line nobody wrote, so the export refuses, naming the field and the character (`U+XXXX`),
before a byte is written.

**Verified from disk.** The bytes go to a temporary file beside the target, are READ BACK,
decoded as windows-1252 and held to the budget: `~V` first (FIEBDC-3/2020, ANSI) and a `~K` declaring the 6 decimals; every
`~C` exactly once (unit, summary, price) and the root at the total; the `~D` yields equal
the takeoff quantities with factor 1; one `~M` per code whose total equals the yield and
the sum of its lines, one line per element with its comment and value. Only then is the
file moved into place and its SHA-256 re-read against the verified bytes. The reply carries
`verified`, `file_path`, `bytes`, `sha256`, `records` (`V`, `K`, `C`, `D`, `M` counts), `idempotency_key`,
`root_code`, `total_amount` and per code `lines[]` (`unit`, `unit_price`, `quantity`,
`amount`, `elements`, `quantity_name`, `conversion_factor`, `coverage`).

### Live probes

`scripts/live-probes/sketch-edits.probes.ps1` stages its own level, floor, ceiling and
footprint roof at X = 1,170,000 mm, types by name from the year's `DefaultMetric.rte`
(names to be confirmed by the first live run). It rehearses a floor loop twice (the second
rehearsal must still read the original boundary), replaces it (24 -> 20 m2), moves one
corner (-2 m2), turns the ceiling into an L (12 -> 9 m2) and expects the roof refused by
name. Each apply is held to the area the probe computed, to `unique_id_kept`, and to an
independent `horizun_query_model` read of the same id. Everything staged, the types copied
from the template included, is deleted with
`horizun_delete_verified mode='ids'`. `export_bc3` needs no Revit: its writer, reader and
verifier are covered by `tests/Horizun.Core.Tests/Bc3RulesTests.cs` and
`tests/Horizun.Server.Tests/BudgetBc3ExportTests.cs`.

### Resumen (español)

`edit_sketch` cambia el contorno de UN suelo, techo o hueco sin recrearlo: se conserva el
id, el UniqueId y todo lo alojado. Reemplaza un lazo (`loop` + `loop_index`) o mueve un
vértice (`start` -> `end`, solo entre líneas), siempre solo en su llamada. Los puntos deben
estar sobre el plano del sketch (1 mm): se rechazan, no se proyectan. El dry run hace de
verdad la edición de las curvas y cancela el scope; como Revit solo revisa el sketch completo
al confirmar el scope en el apply (si lo rechaza, se revierte todo), el plan rechaza antes, por
nombre, un lazo que se cruza a sí mismo o que toca otro lazo. Tras el commit se relee: mismo UniqueId, lazos iguales a lo
pedido, y el área del elemento igual al área del nuevo sketch cuando antes coincidía; si
no coincidía (pendiente, forma editada, un corte) el chequeo de área queda
`not_applicable`, nombrado. Un FootPrintRoof se rechaza por nombre (no tiene SketchId).
Con el mismo número de lados rectos las curvas existentes se reajustan en vez de borrarse
(la pendiente y las cotas siguen en ellas); con otro número se redibuja, y se rechaza por
nombre si una línea define la pendiente o si al borrarla caería otro elemento. Un hueco que
quedaría fuera del contorno, o una isla que quedaría dentro, se rechaza. Los lazos vuelven
también en coordenadas del modelo en las unidades de la petición, con el plano del sketch.

`export_bc3` escribe un FIEBDC-3/2020 ANSI desde el takeoff y la tabla APU del usuario: todo
o nada (un código sin precio se rechaza, nunca se inventa), raíz `HZ_TAKEOFF##`, un `~M` por
código con una línea por elemento, números a 6 decimales con punto. Los separadores
`~ | \`, los caracteres de control y lo que windows-1252 no representa se rechazan en vez
de escaparse, y también `%` y `&` en los códigos (FIEBDC los lee como porcentaje). Un `~K`
declara los 6 decimales escritos. Exige `idempotency_key`: un reintento devuelve la
respuesta registrada tras volver a calcular el hash del archivo. El archivo se verifica
releyéndolo del disco antes de moverlo a su sitio.
