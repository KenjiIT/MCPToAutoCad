# Python fallback recipes

How to turn a missing typed capability into a minimal, transactional, verified
`horizun_execute_python` script. This is the companion to the fallback policy in
the server instructions: **typed first, Python as the fallback — never "not
supported"**.

The engine is IronPython 3 with the standard library bundled (`json`, `re`,
`csv`, `datetime`, `math`). Element ids are 64-bit in Revit 2024+: wrap
`ElementId.Value` in `int()` before serializing.

**What is in scope, without importing anything:**

| Name | Is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `doc` | `Document` | The document `target_document` named, re-checked against the active one |
| `uidoc` | `UIDocument` | |
| `uiapp`, `__revit__` | `UIApplication` | `__revit__` is pyRevit's name for it, aliased so it resolves |
| `app` | `Application` | Same object as `doc.Application` |
| `checkpoint(label, done, total)` | | Reaches the disk immediately; readable from outside via `horizun_job_status` |
| `revit_raised(since=0)` | | What Revit raised so far — see §6 |
| `dialog_answer(answer)` | | Scoped modal answer — see §6 |

**The source can be a file.** Send `code_path` instead of `code` for anything
long: it is read on the machine running Revit, as UTF-8 (a BOM or a
`# -*- coding: -*-` line is honoured), CRLF normalised, and measured and hashed
exactly like inline code. It also makes tracebacks name the real file and line
instead of `<string>`. Exactly one of the two, and a file that does not decode is
refused naming the byte and the offset — never decoded leniently into a script
nobody wrote.

One thing to know about it: **idempotency is bound to the request, and the request
names the path, not the bytes.** Re-sending the same `idempotency_key` after
editing the file replays the original answer and runs nothing. That is
at-most-once working; a changed script is new work and needs a new key.

## 1. When to reach for a recipe

1. **A typed command covers the whole case** → use the typed command. It
   rehearses (`dry_run`), verifies, and re-reads after commit; nothing here can
   match that.
2. **A failed typed call returned `fallback.allowed: true`** → write the minimal
   script for exactly the uncovered part and run it.
3. **Anything else** → do **not** fall back. No `fallback` block, or
   `allowed: false`, means the failure was a fixable argument, a Revit error, or
   a write that may already have landed. A Python retry of a half-finished write
   is a second write, not a recovery.

**Decide on the block, never on the wording.** A failed typed call may carry:

```json
"fallback": {
  "recommended_tool": "horizun_execute_python",
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "unsupported_kind",
  "write_started": false
}
```

**It arrives on the first, ordinary call.** `dry_run` defaults to `true`, and the
rehearsal publishes the verdict in `structuredContent` beside its own payload —
a *successful* reply carrying `invalid` rows still carries the block. You never
need to send `dry_run: false`, or an apply you have no reason to send, to learn
that Python is the way. On a typed refusal the same block arrives in
`structuredContent` and is repeated in the error text for a human.

`allowed: true` means this bridge has no typed capability for the request **and**
refused before writing anything — those two facts together are what make Python safe
here. `write_started: true` never accompanies `allowed: true`. Reasons are
`unsupported_capability`, `unsupported_operation`, `unsupported_kind`,
`unsupported_category` and `out_of_contract_combination`. An error that merely
*sounds* like a capability gap, with no block attached, is not one.

### A mixed batch never grants the fallback

The grant is a property of the **whole request**, not of one entry. A batch that
contains both an action no typed command covers and an action whose arguments
are wrong comes back with `allowed: false` and
`reason: "mixed_capability_and_invalid_input"` — because the request still holds
input you should correct, and generating a script around your own typo is not
the fix.

You do get a map of which is which:

```json
"capability_gaps": [
  { "index": 1, "reason": "unsupported_kind",
    "recommended_tool": "horizun_execute_python",
    "error": "unsupported kind 'sprinkler_head' - ..." }
]
```

Fix the invalid entries, resend the typed call, and only once every remaining
failure is a capability gap does the request earn `allowed: true`.
**`capability_gaps` is a map, not a licence.**

Optionally call the tool once with `preflight: true` (no `idempotency_key`
needed): it checks permission, document, size, script SHA-256 and syntax, and
returns advisory warnings. If the objective is unambiguous and preflight
passes, continue straight to execution — preflight is a check, not an approval
step.

## 2. The evidence contract

**Self-reported, not host-verified.** A typed command is verified *by the
bridge*: it re-reads the model after the commit, in code this repository owns.
Arbitrary Python is not re-read by anything, so the strongest state this path
can return is `self_reported_verified` — your script said it checked and
attached evidence, and nothing on the host side confirmed it. There is no
`verified` state here at all, and `host_verified` is always `false`. Say so when
you report to a user: the evidence is the script's testimony, not the bridge's
finding.

Assign `__output__` this shape. The bridge classifies it strictly and **never
upgrades**: a `verified` claim without re-read evidence is downgraded to
`completed_unverified`, and a `verified` claim *with* evidence becomes
`self_reported_verified`.

```json
{
  "status": "verified | completed_unverified | partial | failed",
  "summary": "one short sentence of what happened",
  "created_ids": [],
  "modified_ids": [],
  "deleted_ids": [],
  "verification": { "checked": true, "evidence": [] },
  "warnings": []
}
```

You write `status: "verified"` when you re-read what you wrote; the response
comes back classified as one of:

- `self_reported_verified` — you declared `verified`, set `checked: true` and
  attached non-empty `evidence`. **The host confirmed none of it.**
- `completed_unverified` — the script finished but presented nothing checkable
  (including a `verified` claim with empty evidence, which is downgraded here).
- `partial` — part of the operation happened, or only part could be verified.
- `failed` — the script's own failure report (an uncaught exception fails the
  whole command anyway).

The response also carries `script_reported_status` (what you declared, verbatim)
so classifying never destroys information.

Make the evidence worth reading. `["ok"]` and an echo of `doc.Title` satisfy the
shape and demonstrate nothing — the classifier cannot tell them from a real
re-read, which is exactly why it refuses to call any of it verified. Put the ids
and property values you actually read back from the model in there.

`print()` still works and still comes back in `printed`, but it is
compatibility output; the structured `__output__` is what a client should read.

## 3. The reusable template

Every mutating recipe is this skeleton with a different middle. It validates
the document, groups the work in a `TransactionGroup`, guarantees `Commit()` or
`RollBack()` in `finally`, re-reads what it touched, and serializes evidence.

```python
import json
from Autodesk.Revit.DB import Transaction, TransactionGroup, ElementId

result = {
    "status": "failed", "summary": "",
    "created_ids": [], "modified_ids": [], "deleted_ids": [],
    "verification": {"checked": False, "evidence": []},
    "warnings": [],
}

# -- 1. Validate the document before touching anything. -----------------------
if doc is None or doc.IsFamilyDocument:  # adjust the guard to the task
    result["summary"] = "expected a project document and did not get one"
    __output__ = result
else:
    tg = TransactionGroup(doc, "fallback: <name the operation>")
    tg.Start()
    try:
        t = Transaction(doc, "fallback: <step>")
        t.Start()
        committed = False
        try:
            # -- 2. The actual work goes here. --------------------------------
            # new_element = ...
            # result["created_ids"].append(int(new_element.Id.Value))
            t.Commit()
            committed = True
        finally:
            if not committed and t.HasStarted() and not t.HasEnded():
                t.RollBack()   # never leave a transaction open

        # -- 3. Re-read AFTER the commit; evidence comes from the model. ------
        evidence = []
        for eid in result["created_ids"]:
            e = doc.GetElement(ElementId(eid))
            if e is None:
                result["warnings"].append("id %d not found on re-read" % eid)
            else:
                evidence.append({"id": eid, "category": e.Category.Name if e.Category else None})

        tg.Assimilate()  # one undo step; use tg.RollBack() to abort everything

        # -- 4. Classify honestly. -------------------------------------------
        if evidence and len(evidence) == len(result["created_ids"]):
            result["status"] = "verified"
            result["verification"] = {"checked": True, "evidence": evidence}
        elif evidence:
            result["status"] = "partial"
            result["verification"] = {"checked": True, "evidence": evidence}
        else:
            result["status"] = "completed_unverified"
        result["summary"] = "<what was done>, %d element(s) re-read" % len(evidence)
    except Exception as ex:
        if tg.HasStarted() and not tg.HasEnded():
            tg.RollBack()
        result["status"] = "failed"
        result["summary"] = str(ex)
    __output__ = result
```

Notes on the skeleton:

- The `finally` with `RollBack()` is not decoration. The command cannot close a
  transaction your script leaves open — the Revit API gives it no handle — and
  a run that leaves the document modifiable is reported as a **failure**, with
  the script's writes discarded by Revit's own cleanup.
- Re-reading through `doc.GetElement` after the commit is what earns
  `verified`. Evidence is what you re-read, not what you intended.
- For read-only scripts, drop the transactions and report
  `status: "verified"` with the read values as evidence — a read that shows its
  data has verified itself.

### IronPython environment gotchas (measured in the field, 2026-08-07)

Two traps a 123-model batch day paid for, so the next script does not:

- **`System` is NOT pre-imported, even though `clr` is.** `clr.AddReference(...)`
  works on the first line, and `System.IO.File` on the next raises `NameError`.
  Write `import System` explicitly before touching anything under it.
- **`System.Array.CreateInstance` fails where the generic indexer works.** Build
  .NET arrays with `System.Array[System.Byte](sequence)` — the
  `CreateInstance`-then-assign route dies in this host where the one-shot
  constructor form succeeds.

## 4. Worked examples

### 4a. A detail line in a drafting view (no typed capability)

No typed command draws a `DetailCurve`. The fallback, complete:

```python
import json
from Autodesk.Revit.DB import Transaction, Line, XYZ, ElementId

VIEW_NAME = "DET-100"           # the drafting/plan view to draw in
P0 = (0.0, 0.0)                  # feet, view plane
P1 = (10.0, 0.0)

result = {"status": "failed", "summary": "", "created_ids": [],
          "modified_ids": [], "deleted_ids": [],
          "verification": {"checked": False, "evidence": []}, "warnings": []}

from Autodesk.Revit.DB import FilteredElementCollector, View
view = None
for v in FilteredElementCollector(doc).OfClass(View):
    if not v.IsTemplate and v.Name == VIEW_NAME:
        view = v
        break

if view is None:
    result["summary"] = "view '%s' not found" % VIEW_NAME
    __output__ = result
else:
    t = Transaction(doc, "fallback: detail line in %s" % VIEW_NAME)
    t.Start()
    committed = False
    try:
        line = Line.CreateBound(XYZ(P0[0], P0[1], 0), XYZ(P1[0], P1[1], 0))
        dc = doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(view, line)
        new_id = int(dc.Id.Value)
        t.Commit()
        committed = True
    finally:
        if not committed and t.HasStarted() and not t.HasEnded():
            t.RollBack()

    if committed:
        re_read = doc.GetElement(ElementId(new_id))
        if re_read is not None:
            curve = re_read.GeometryCurve
            result["status"] = "verified"
            result["created_ids"] = [new_id]
            result["verification"] = {"checked": True, "evidence": [{
                "id": new_id,
                "owner_view": int(re_read.OwnerViewId.Value),
                "length_ft": curve.Length,
            }]}
            result["summary"] = "detail line %d drawn in '%s'" % (new_id, VIEW_NAME)
        else:
            result["status"] = "completed_unverified"
            result["summary"] = "commit succeeded but the line could not be re-read"
    __output__ = result
```

### 4b. Reading a parameter no typed tool projects

Read-only: no transaction, and the read values are their own evidence.

```python
from Autodesk.Revit.DB import FilteredElementCollector, BuiltInCategory

PARAM = "Fire Rating"            # any parameter name
rows, missing = [], 0
for w in (FilteredElementCollector(doc)
          .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Walls)
          .WhereElementIsNotElementType()):
    p = w.LookupParameter(PARAM)
    if p is None:
        missing += 1
    else:
        rows.append({"id": int(w.Id.Value), "value": p.AsValueString() or p.AsString()})

__output__ = {
    "status": "verified",
    "summary": "%d walls read, %d without the parameter" % (len(rows), missing),
    "created_ids": [], "modified_ids": [], "deleted_ids": [],
    "verification": {"checked": True, "evidence": rows[:50]},
    "warnings": (["evidence truncated to 50 of %d rows" % len(rows)] if len(rows) > 50 else []),
}
```

(`absent` and `empty` are different facts — count them separately, as above.)

### 4c. A transactional modification, verified

Writing a value the typed writer does not cover (say, flipping a flag on a
collection resolved by geometry). The pattern is the template's: write inside
the transaction, collect ids, **re-read after commit**, compare the re-read
value to the intended one, and let the comparison choose between `verified`,
`partial` and `completed_unverified`:

```python
# inside the template's step 2:
p = element.LookupParameter("Comments")
p.Set("checked-by-fallback")
result["modified_ids"].append(int(element.Id.Value))

# inside the template's step 3, per modified id:
e = doc.GetElement(ElementId(eid))
actual = e.LookupParameter("Comments").AsString()
evidence.append({"id": eid, "expected": "checked-by-fallback", "actual": actual,
                 "match": actual == "checked-by-fallback"})
# only all-match earns "verified"; any mismatch is "partial" with the rows shown
```

## 5. What the fallback must never do

- Duplicate a typed command wholesale. The advisory in the response names the
  typed replacement when your script calls one of those APIs; the typed command
  re-reads its work with machinery a script has to rebuild by hand. (The
  advisory scans code only: it is masked with Python's own lexer, so a mention in
  a comment, a string or a docstring does not trigger it. **Documented limit:**
  an f-string is a single string token to that lexer, so an API call inside
  `f"{...}"` is masked too and raises no advisory — the conservative direction
  for a hint, and asserted in the tests so nobody reads the tokenizer as a
  precision promise it does not make.)
- Retry a failed typed write. See §1.
- Report a Python result to a user as "verified". It is `self_reported_verified`
  at best — the script's testimony, not the bridge's finding.
- Claim `verified` without evidence. The bridge downgrades the claim; write the
  re-read instead.
- Leave a transaction open. The command detects it, fails the run, and the
  writes are lost.
- Assume rollback. There is **no automatic rollback** for Python: what your
  script committed stays committed even when a later line throws. The
  `TransactionGroup` pattern in §3 is how you make "all or nothing" true.

## 6. Opening models in a batch, and the dialog that stops one

The bridge **cancels** every modal dialog Revit raises during a script, because
nobody is at the keyboard. That is right, and it has a cost: all Revit tells your
script is

```
Opening was canceled.
```

which is not a diagnosis. Three models were reported unauditable with no cause on
2026-08-13, and four the month before, for exactly this.

**Read the record.** `revit_raised(since=0)` returns what Revit has raised so far
during this script — dialogs, warnings and errors, each with `kind`,
`description`, `answered`, `elements` and `while`. Bookmark before the call and
ask again after it, and you get exactly what that call raised:

```python
checkpoint(name)                    # `while` on anything raised from here on
before = len(revit_raised())
try:
    opened = app.OpenDocumentFile(ModelPathUtils.ConvertUserVisiblePathToModelPath(path), opts)
except Exception as ex:
    reason = str(ex)
    raised = revit_raised(before)   # the dialogs THIS open raised
    row["failed_because"] = raised[0]["description"] if raised else reason
```

The same records come back on the reply as `dialogs` and `failures`, beside
`__output__`, with `revit_raised_observed` — **an empty list from a run nobody
watched is not a quiet run**, and the reply says which it was.

`while` is the script's own last `checkpoint()` label at that instant. The bridge
cannot see which API call was in flight and does not pretend to, so checkpoint per
model if you want every dialog attributed to one.

**Letting an open continue.** Some models raise a dialog whose only sensible
unattended answer is "acknowledge and continue". Around that one call:

```python
with dialog_answer('dismiss'):
    opened = app.OpenDocumentFile(model_path, opts)
```

Scoped deliberately, and never as a run-wide switch: `dismiss` answers OK to
*everything*, and Revit reads OK on a close-with-changes dialog as **Save** — a
read-only audit could write to every model it touched. Outside the block, dialogs
cancel as before.

And a model that will not open unattended is still a **finding**. `dismiss` makes
it measurable; it does not make it fine.
