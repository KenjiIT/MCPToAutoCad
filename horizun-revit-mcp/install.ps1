  Install Horizun Revit MCP on THIS machine, from this source tree.

  This is the path an AI agent (Claude Code, Codex) or a person follows after
  cloning the repository: no installer download, no additional executables -
  everything that runs is built here, from the code you can read, against the
  Revit already installed on this machine.

  What it does, in order:

    1  Finds every Revit (2023-2027) installed on this machine, by looking for
       its RevitAPI.dll. Only those years are built: the add-in compiles
       against each Revit's OWN API, so a year that is not installed cannot be
       built here - and does not need to be.
    2  Builds the add-in once per year, and the MCP server once. Everything is
       built and STAGED before anything is installed, so a build failure - the
       commonest failure - changes nothing at all.
    3  Installs the add-in for each year and the server. A failure after this
       point walks the undo ledger backwards and reports exactly what state
       the machine is in.
    4  Reads every installed binary BACK: the commit it was built from and the
       SHA-256 against what was staged. All halves must name one commit -
       that is what "the server and the add-in are paired" actually means.
    5  Prints the MCP client configuration to add, for Claude Code and Codex.

  What it needs:

    * Windows, with at least one Revit 2023-2027 installed.
    * The exact .NET SDK in global.json (currently 10.0.400). The SDK is fixed for
      reproducible release bytes; targets remain net48/net8/net10 by Revit year.
      SDK-style restore obtains the .NET Framework 4.8 references for older Revit.
    * Revit CLOSED. Revit holds a lock on the add-in DLL it loaded; this
      refuses to run while any Revit is open, and changes nothing.

  Usage:   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
           ... -Years 2025,2026    only these years (default: every installed one)
           ... -SkipServer         add-in only - you own the pairing then

  Exit codes:  0 installed and verified   1 refused or failed (message says why)
