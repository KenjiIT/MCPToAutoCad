; Horizun MCP — installer.
;
; Installs the MCP server once, and the Revit add-in once PER INSTALLED REVIT
; YEAR — with the artifact built against THAT YEAR'S OWN RevitAPI. That is the
; whole reason this file is not three lines.
;
; The runtimes differ (2024 and earlier host .NET Framework 4.8, 2025-2026 host
; .NET 8, 2027 hosts .NET 10) and a runtime mismatch never loads at all. But the
; APIs differ too, between every one of these years, and that failure is worse:
; a plugin compiled against 2026 and loaded by 2025 loads fine and then throws at
; the first call to a method that version does not have - which reads as a broken
; command rather than a broken install. The payload therefore carries one folder
; per year, not one per runtime.
;
; A year that is not installed is skipped, not guessed at. A year whose deploy
; FAILS is reported as failed and rolled back to whatever was there before.
;
; Nothing outside Horizun's own folders is touched: no other add-in is
; modified. Client registration is completed only while that client is closed;
; otherwise a per-user helper records the pending work and waits safely.
;
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; RELEASE SIGNING AND REVIT TRUST:
;
;   Signing the DLL is NOT enough. A signed add-in from a publisher the machine
;   does not know still raises a dialog — it changes from the red "Unsigned
;   Add-In" to "Signed Add-In" with an Always Load button, shown once per
;   certificate per machine instead of per binary. To get NO dialog at all on a
;   clean machine, the release must carry a valid public Authenticode chain.
;   Stable CI signs the five add-ins, server exe/dll and this wrapper, and then
;   rechecks them on a clean hosted Windows runner. This installer never imports
;   a private root certificate or weakens the machine's trust policy.

  This used to run xcopy and never look at what it returned, then add the year to
  the "installed" list unconditionally. So a copy that failed - a locked file, a
  full disk, a permission - produced a success dialog naming a year that had not
  been installed, and left the previous build half-overwritten. The user then
  reports a bug that was fixed in a version they are not running.

  Now: copy into a staging folder BESIDE the target, verify it, and only then
  swap. If anything fails, the previous install is put back and the year is
  reported as failed. A year is added to InstalledYears only after the swap and a
  post-swap check both succeed.

    { A MACHINE-READABLE RESULT, because the dialog is for a person and an
      unattended install has nobody reading it.

      Measured 2026-07-30 by holding a file open inside Addins\2027\Horizun -
      exactly what Revit does - and running /SILENT: 2027 correctly failed and
      was left intact, the other four deployed, and the process still exited
      with code 0. A script reading that exit code would record a partial
      install as a success, which is the same defect as a test printing PASS
      without running.

      Inno Setup returns 0 from any install that completes, and offers no
      supported way to return a different code from ssPostInstall. So the result
      is written where a caller can read it instead, and the limitation is
      stated rather than left to be discovered:

        EXIT CODE 0 DOES NOT MEAN EVERY YEAR DEPLOYED. Read install-result.txt. }
    SaveStringToFile(ExpandConstant('{param:HORIZUNRESULT|' + ExpandConstant('{app}') + '\install-result.txt}'),
      'version=' + '{#AppVersion}' + #13#10 +
      (* WHEN. Added after a silent install FAILED TO INITIALIZE (exit 1, nothing
         deployed) and left the PREVIOUS run's result file sitting in the install
         folder - four hours old, saying fully_installed=yes. A caller that reads
         this file without knowing when it was written cannot tell a successful
         install from a failed one that changed nothing, and the CI gate written
         that same afternoon would have called it a success.

         A reader must check BOTH: the process exit code is 0, and this stamp is
         from the run it just performed.

         Note for whoever edits this comment: it is a star-paren comment because
         an earlier version was a brace comment that quoted an Inno constant by
         name, and a brace comment ends at the first closing brace - so it
         terminated inside its own prose. Do not write either comment delimiter
         in here. Both failures were found by the compiler, four lines apart. *)
      (* LOCAL time, and the field name says so. It was written as installed_utc
         first, and GetDateTimeString returns local: on this machine that is
         UTC-5, so the stamp read five hours in the PAST and the freshness check
         reading it as UTC rejected a perfectly good install as stale. A field
         whose name states a timezone it is not in is worse than one with no
         timezone at all. Inno offers no UTC form, so the name follows the value. *)
