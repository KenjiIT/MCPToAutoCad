# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Horizun Revit MCP - an ISOLATED Revit session for DWG -> BIM evaluation runs.
#
#   session.ps1 start    [-Year 2026] [-FailAction <action key>] [-DeclineAddIn <name>...]
#   session.ps1 register [-Year 2026] [-ExpectedTitle <title>] [-SourceFile <path>]
#   session.ps1 stop     [-Year 2026]
#   session.ps1 status   [-Year 2026]
#
# A thin wrapper over scripts/live/owned-session.ps1, which applies the rules of
# scripts/live/year-matrix.session.ps1 (and its tests) to a session that spans
# several commands. In short:
#   start    builds this tree for the year, refuses if ANY Revit of that year - or
#            one whose year cannot be read - is running, snapshots the year, enables
#            the development manifest, starts Revit and records pid + start time +
#            executable; then waits until the bridge answers FOR THAT PID. While it
#            waits it may close Autodesk's Insights notice on that pid, and answer
#            "Do Not Load" to the unsigned-add-in prompt ONLY for an add-in named in
#            -DeclineAddIn (never Horizun). -FailAction sets HORIZUN_TEST_FAIL_ACTION
#            for the started Revit only.
#   register records the ACTIVE document by the path the bridge publishes. The
#            drivers call it after every open or save-as that reported success; a
#            document that is not registered is somebody else's.
#   stop     closes only documents in the register, one at a time, re-reading the
#            session before each; any other document - or an unanswered health, or
#            an identity that no longer matches - leaves Revit RUNNING and writes
#            recovery pending. The process is asked to exit, never killed. The
#            manifest is restored and verified against the start snapshot.
#   status   prints the recorded state; changes nothing.
#
# Writes the server path to $env:TEMP\hz_srv.txt and the year to $env:TEMP\hz_year.txt,
# which the drivers pass as HORIZUN_SERVER_EXE and HORIZUN_REVIT_YEAR.
