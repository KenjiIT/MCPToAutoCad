  Shared by deploy.ps1 and deploy-both.ps1.

  WHY IT EXISTS. deploy-both needs something deploy.ps1 cannot give it: nothing may
  land until EVERY half has been built, and if any step fails, everything must go
  back. That means the copy has to be callable from a caller that owns the
  transaction, and the two scripts must not end up with two versions of "how a
  payload is installed" - which is the same divergence that had two open commands
  running different guards for months.

  Everything here is a step. Nothing here decides policy; the callers do.

# The provenance stamp the build bakes into every assembly: version+sha[-dirty].
# Read from the BYTES, not by loading the assembly - loading would lock the file

    # ASK THE BINARY, do not read its entrails.
    #
    # This used to scan the raw bytes for a regex, and it was wrong twice over.
    # The stamp is the InformationalVersion - <version>+<40-hex sha>[-dirty] -
    # and the compiler writes it into the Win32 version resource as
    # ProductVersion, which is a declared field with a documented meaning.
    #
    # What the byte scan got wrong, in the order it hurt:
    #
    #   1. It demanded \d+\.\d+\.\d+ immediately before the '+', so any SEMVER
    #      PRERELEASE version failed to match. 1.1.0-dev is exactly the
    #      unambiguous development identity this repository uses between
    #      releases, and every binary built from such a tree read as "no
    #      provenance stamp". The deploy gate then refused to ship a binary that
    #      could not say which commit it was - the gate was right, the reader
    #      was wrong.
    #
    #   2. MEASURED on the built DLL: the byte immediately before the string is
    #      the custom attribute's LENGTH PREFIX, and "1.1.0-dev+" plus 40 hex is
    #      exactly 50 characters - so that prefix byte is 0x32, which is the
    #      ASCII digit '2'. The scan read "21.1.0-dev". A version that is nearly
    #      right is the worst kind, and no lookbehind can fix it, because the
    #      length byte is genuinely a digit character.
    #
    # ProductVersion has neither problem. The byte scan survives only as a
    # fallback for a binary with no version resource, and it says so.

  EVERY FILE OF AN INSTALLED PAYLOAD, hashed.

  The release manifest used to carry two hashes: horizun-mcp.exe and, per year,
  Horizun.Revit.dll. Those are the two files whose provenance anybody thinks about,
  and they are a small minority of what actually gets installed. Newtonsoft.Json,
  IronPython, Microsoft.Scripting and the whole Python standard library ship
  alongside them, are loaded by the same process, and were covered by nothing: a
  release could be verified as correct with a corrupted IronPython.dll next to a
  perfect Horizun.Revit.dll, and the failure would surface as a broken
  execute_python weeks later with no way back to the install.

  THE STDLIB IS AGGREGATED, deliberately and visibly. It is roughly two thousand
  .py files; listing them individually would make the manifest unreadable and
  unreviewable, which is its own kind of unverifiable. Instead every file under
  lib\ contributes its relative path AND its hash to one ordered digest, so a
  single changed byte anywhere in the tree changes the aggregate - and the file
  count is carried beside it so a tree that lost files cannot match one that did not.

# (Test-HorizunStageMatchesManifest).
