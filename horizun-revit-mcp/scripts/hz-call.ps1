#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
  Call one Horizun tool over the real MCP transport, from a script.

  WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A CHAT CLIENT. Evidence for a release has to be
  reproducible and machine-readable. A tool call made through a chat window
  leaves a narration; this leaves the request, the reply, the duration and the
  exit status, in JSON, from the SAME stdio transport a client uses - the
  installed horizun-mcp.exe speaking JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout.

  It is also the harness the workflow runs need: seven skills, each run twice,
  with inputs and outputs hashed. That is not something to drive by hand.

  This helper sends ONE request and waits for its reply. Separate helper processes
  may run concurrently: the add-in admits them to its bounded FIFO queue and still
  executes only one Revit API command at a time. A full queue is refused as explicit
  backpressure; accepted calls report their measured wait in bridge_queue.

    scripts/hz-call.ps1 -Tool horizun_health
    scripts/hz-call.ps1 -Tool horizun_open_document -Arguments '{"path":"C:\\x\\a.rvt"}'
    scripts/hz-call.ps1 -Tool horizun_execute_python -Arguments (Get-Content q.json -Raw) -Json out.json

  Exit codes:  0 the tool answered   1 the tool returned an error   2 no reply
