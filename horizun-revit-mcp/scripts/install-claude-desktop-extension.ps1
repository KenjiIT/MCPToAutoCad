  Install, repair, diagnose or remove the Horizun integration in Claude Desktop.

  NO CLAUDE CODE. Nothing here runs `claude`, needs the CLI on PATH, or touches
  ~/.claude.json. Claude Desktop and Claude Code are different products with
  different configuration; this script only ever deals with the desktop app.

  TWO ROUTES, and which one this takes BY DEFAULT:

  1. THE CONFIGURATION ENTRY - what runs unless you ask otherwise. Writing
     mcpServers."horizun-revit" into claude_desktop_config.json is documented,
     scriptable, verified by reading the file back, and gives exactly the same
     result as the extension. It finishes on its own, which is why it leads:
     asking somebody to find a .mcpb inside %LOCALAPPDATA% and hand it to a file
     picker is a step most people never complete, and an integration nobody
     finishes is an integration that does not exist. The path is written ALREADY
     EXPANDED for this machine, because the app does not expand %LOCALAPPDATA%
     and a configuration written with it points nowhere.

  2. THE EXTENSION (.mcpb), with -Extension. Claude Desktop installs one from
     Settings > Extensions > Advanced settings > Install Extension. That final
     step happens in the app's own UI and there is no documented command for it,
     so this script prepares everything up to it, PUTS THE FILE WHERE A PERSON
     CAN FIND IT - Documents\Horizun by default, or wherever -SaveTo or the
     prompt says, with Explorer opened on it - and records `pending_user_action`
     naming the step. It does NOT write into the app's extension store: that
     directory carries per-extension metadata the app maintains, and forging an
     entry there is inventing a private format.

  Either way the package is still staged and validated, so -Extension never has
  to build anything the default run did not already prove.

  WHAT IT REFUSES. Claude Desktop rewrites its configuration from memory while it
  runs, so an edit made underneath it is lost silently and the symptom is "the
  tools never appeared". A running Claude Desktop is therefore refused rather
  than edited hopefully, and the state recorded is pending_client_restart.

  WHAT IT PRESERVES. Other extensions are never touched. Every other key in
  claude_desktop_config.json is preserved and checked after the write; if any went
  missing the backup is restored and the operation reports failure.
