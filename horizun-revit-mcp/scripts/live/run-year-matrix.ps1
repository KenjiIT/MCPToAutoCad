.SYNOPSIS
  Run a set of live harnesses against ONE Revit year, in an isolated development
  session, and put the machine back the way it was - including when a harness fails.

.DESCRIPTION
  The modified paths of a release have to be measured in every Revit year that
  ships them, and doing that by hand is where a matrix goes wrong: a manifest
  left swapped, a Revit left running, a year skipped and reported as passing.

  This driver does one year at a time:

    1. REFUSES if a Revit of that year is already running - or if any Revit is
       running whose year could NOT be determined, because an unreadable
       MainModule is not "no Revit". Somebody may be working in it, and this
       script will not close somebody else's session.
    2. Builds the add-in FOR THAT YEAR (bin is shared across years, so the
       previous year's output would otherwise be loaded and the TFM guard would
       refuse it - or worse, not).
    3. Enables the development session: only that year's manifest is swapped,
       for a signed copy of the build. The installed pair is not replaced.
    4. Starts Revit BY ITS EXECUTABLE and waits for the bridge to publish.
    5. Runs each harness with HORIZUN_SERVER_EXE pointed at the fresh server,
       and HORIZUN_HARNESS_DOCUMENTS_MANIFEST pointed at a fresh JSON per harness
       run in the year's artifact folder (cleared afterwards). A harness that
       creates and opens models of its own - verify-live.ps1 does, under
       %TEMP%\horizun-live-<run> - writes there which ones (schema
       horizun.harness-documents/v1, rewritten in a finally so a harness that
       dies half-way still declares them). After the harness, each entry is
       adopted into the SAME register (kind 'harness_scratch') only if the
       schema is right, the scratch folder is a direct child of the temp
       directory named horizun-live-<probe_run>, is not a link, and was created
       AFTER this driver started that Revit, and the path is inside that folder
       (no '..'), is a .rvt/.rfa and exists. Anything refused is written down in
       the run's harness_documents and stays foreign; a model of that folder the
       manifest did not list stays foreign too. Before 2026-09-24 nothing was
       adopted and every year ended left_running_foreign_document.
    6. Closes ONLY the Revit it started - and only after proving, right before
       the close, that it is still the same process (pid + start time +
       executable), that the bridge can say what is open AND answers for that
       pid, and that every open document is one THIS RUN REGISTERED, matched by
       the path the bridge publishes rather than by its title (a harness's
       adopted scratch models are closed the same way, discarding changes: they
       are that harness's own disposable copies). One foreign
       document, one doubtful identity or one unanswered question and the Revit
       is LEFT RUNNING, written down as recovery pending. Each close is aimed at
       the registered path and refused if the bridge's own rehearsal resolves a
       different document; the open set is re-read before every close and once
       more before the process is asked to exit normally through its own window.
       It is never killed. Then the manifest is restored - only with no Revit of
       that year and no Revit of an unknown year running, and believed only when
       the restore's exit code AND the disk agree with the snapshot taken before
       anything changed. See year-matrix.session.ps1 for the rules and their tests.

  Every step's result is written to a per-year JSON summary beside the harness
  artifacts, so a year that could not run says why instead of being absent.

.PARAMETER Years
  Which Revit years to sweep. Each is independent; one blocked year does not
  stop the rest.

.PARAMETER Harness
  Harness file names under scripts/live, with their arguments as one string.
  Example: 'verify-registry-contract.ps1 -Mode matched'

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
  Use the existing bin output for the year. Only for a re-run minutes after a
  build; the TFM guard still refuses a mismatch.
