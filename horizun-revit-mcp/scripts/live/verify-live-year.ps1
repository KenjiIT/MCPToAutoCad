.SYNOPSIS
  Adapter so run-year-matrix.ps1 can drive scripts/verify-live.ps1 for one year.

.DESCRIPTION
  run-year-matrix.ps1 runs harnesses that live in scripts/live and hands each one
  -ArtifactDir; verify-live.ps1 lives in scripts/ and writes its report to -Json.
  This adapter forwards every other argument unchanged, points verify-live at the
  development server the driver built (HORIZUN_SERVER_EXE) and writes the report
  into the driver's per-year artifact folder. It adds no probe and decides nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  & scripts/live/run-year-matrix.ps1 -Years 2026 `
      -PrepareDocument @('2026=C:\hz-live\HZ_WRITE.rvt') `
      -Harness @('verify-live-year.ps1 -Document {title} -WriteProbes -WriteDocument {title} -WriteDocumentDisposable yes-this-model-is-disposable')
