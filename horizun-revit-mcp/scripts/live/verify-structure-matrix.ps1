  THE MULTIVERSION MATRIX: the structural suites, on every installed Revit.

  This has been deferred since the reinforcement work began, for a good reason -
  behaviour proved on one year and multiplied by five is a number nobody has
  measured. It is run here with express authorisation.

  What it does, per year, and why each step is the way it is:

  * ONE REVIT AT A TIME. The bridge refuses to pick between two Revits of the
    same year, and correctly; two DIFFERENT years at once is worse, because the
    resolver would have to guess which one a call meant. So every year begins by
    closing everything and ends by closing everything.

  * REVIT IS STARTED BY ITS OWN EXE. The .rvt association on this machine is
    Revit 2027, so handing a file to the shell starts the wrong year against an
    add-in built for a different one - which then shows ITS unsigned-add-in
    dialog and reads exactly like the year under test failing to load.

  * THE MODEL IS OPENED THROUGH THE BRIDGE. Revit's own open raises the warnings
    roll-up on these fixtures, and a modal with nobody at the keyboard stops
    Revit servicing the bridge at all - so every later call is refused with
    "Revit has a MODAL DIALOG open" and the year reads as a bridge that never
    came up.

  * A YEAR THAT WILL NOT COME UP IS RECORDED, NOT SKIPPED. The whole point of a
    matrix is to say which years were measured and which were not, so a year
    that fails to start is a row with a reason rather than an absence.

  Each year runs the same two harnesses against that year's own disposable
  fixture. Nothing is ever saved.
