#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
  Build everything a machine needs, stage it, and produce the installer.

  "Everything" means ONE ARTIFACT PER SUPPORTED REVIT YEAR - 2023 through 2027 -
  each compiled against that year's own RevitAPI.dll.

  It used to be one per RUNTIME, on the reasoning that years sharing a target
  framework can share a binary. They share a framework; they do not share an API.
  RevitAPI.dll differs between every one of these years, so a plugin compiled
  against 2026 and loaded by 2025 binds to methods that version does not have -
  and it fails at the first CALL, not at load, which reads like a broken command
  rather than a broken install.

  The output path does not carry the year, so the builds would overwrite each
  other in bin: each is copied out to its own staging folder the moment it is
  built, and its target framework is re-read from the staged bytes before the next
  build starts. A year whose Revit is not installed on this machine is reported and
  LEFT OUT, never substituted.

  Usage:
    pwsh scripts/pack.ps1                 # build + stage + compile the installer
    pwsh scripts/pack.ps1 -SkipInstaller  # build + stage only
    pwsh scripts/pack.ps1 -InstallerOnly  # compile the installer from what is ALREADY staged

  To ship SIGNED, the order matters, because a normal run wipes the staging folder
  and would throw the signatures away:

    pack.ps1 -SkipInstaller     ->  sign.ps1     ->  pack.ps1 -InstallerOnly
    (build and stage)              (sign the        (wrap the signed payload)
                                    staged files)

  Then sign the produced setup.exe too: signing the wrapper does not sign what is
  inside it, and signing what is inside does not sign the wrapper.
