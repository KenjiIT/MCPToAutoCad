  Keep %LOCALAPPDATA%\Horizun\install-status.json TRUTHFUL across dev deploys.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The durable install record is written by the installer's
  completion flow and then never again. A dev deploy (scripts/deploy-both.ps1)
  swaps every binary underneath that record, and the file keeps claiming the
  OLD health - measured on this machine on 2026-08-26: the record said
  live_verified 0.9.6/32baa87 while the running bridge answered 1.0.0/f39c84a.
  A durable state that outlives the bytes it describes is not state, it is a
  stale claim with a timestamp.

  TWO MODES, both honest about what they know:

    -DeployedCommit <sha>   The deploy path just verified new binaries on disk
                            but nobody has asked the live bridge anything yet.
                            The record is DOWNGRADED to deployed_pending_health,
                            names the new commit, and DROPS the old health block
                            - that block described bytes that are no longer
                            installed.

    (no arguments)          Ask the installed server for horizun_health NOW,
                            and check the answer against the bytes on disk
                            before believing it.

                            live_verified is a claim about THIS installation,
                            so "healthy" alone does not earn it. Five things
                            have to agree, and each is recorded with the answer:

                              the server that replied is the one INSTALLED at
                              server_path - compared by SHA-256, because a
                              different horizun-mcp.exe left running from an
                              earlier build answers just as cheerfully;

                              the commit it reports is the commit stamped into
                              that binary - an old add-in paired with a new
                              server reports healthy and is not this build;

                              the contract hash is readable from
                              horizun://build/identity - the two halves publish
                              it and a mismatch means they are not a pair;

                              Revit itself is named - version, build and process
                              - because health without a Revit is health about
                              nothing;

                              and a document is open, because every command in
                              this bridge acts on the active one.

                            Anything missing or disagreeing writes
                            deployed_pending_health with the reason. A health
                            block is never invented, and never kept when it
                            describes bytes that are no longer installed.

  The installer's own completion flow remains the authority during an install:
  it writes generation-guarded records. This refresher touches only the
  top-level status file, atomically, and preserves the installer's identity
  fields (client, generation, verification_path) so the two writers describe
  one lineage.
