    WHAT LEAKED, AND WHAT WOULD LEAK NEXT TIME.

    The client, project and model names were taken out of this repository by
    hand, twice, and each time by editing the files somebody remembered. That is
    the method that leaves the fourth file behind. This is the method that does
    not: it reads every tracked file, every time, in CI.

    THE WORDLIST IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY, and that is the whole design. A
    scanner that greps for "AcmeCorp" has to contain the string "AcmeCorp" - so
    the thing meant to prove the names are gone becomes the file that publishes
    them, and it is the file nobody thinks to check. So:

      * STRUCTURAL checks run always and need no list at all. They catch the
        shapes that leak regardless of who the client is: a home directory with
        a real user name in it, an e-mail address, a model or family filename
        that is not obviously a placeholder, a cloud project path.

      * The NAME check is opt-in, from a wordlist OUTSIDE the repository -
        %USERPROFILE%\.horizun\sensitive-terms.txt by default, one term per
        line, # for comments. Absent, it is reported as NOT RUN rather than
        silently passing. "No wordlist" and "no matches" are different answers
        and must never print the same way.

    It scans TRACKED FILES ONLY (git ls-files). Untracked working files are the
    operator's own business; what ships is what git carries.
