  End the "Security - Unsigned Add-In" dialog for good, without buying anything.

  WHY THE REGISTRY TRICK IS NOT ENOUGH. Measured 2026-08-04: Revit's Always Load
  record is keyed to the BINARY, not to the AddInId. With every add-in on a machine
  marked trusted in HKCU\...\CodeSigning, Revit still prompted for exactly the two
  whose DLL had changed that week. So each rebuild re-arms the dialog, and a
  development loop that reinstalls six times in a morning produces six rounds of
  prompts across five Revit years. scripts/trust-addin.ps1 remains useful for
  reporting and for add-ins nobody is rebuilding; it cannot fix this.

  WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. Creates a self-signed CODE SIGNING certificate, trusts it
  for THIS Windows user, and signs the installed binaries with it. Trust then lives
  on the certificate rather than on a file hash, so rebuilding and re-signing does
  not re-prompt. Nothing is bought: New-SelfSignedCertificate and
  Set-AuthenticodeSignature ship with Windows.

  WHAT IT COSTS YOU, stated plainly because it is a real security decision:
  anything signed with this certificate becomes trusted for this user. The private
  key stays in your own CurrentUser store, non-exportable, and only you can sign
  with it - but you are creating a publisher you trust, so treat the key as yours
  alone. It is per-user: no elevation, nothing machine-wide, no other account
  affected. -Remove undoes all of it.

  WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a purchased certificate. A bought one exists so OTHER
  people's machines trust the build without installing anything; this solves it only
  where the certificate is trusted - your machines and your team's. Windows may still
  warn about the unsigned INSTALLER on a machine that has not trusted this.

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\self-sign.ps1
    ... -Report    what exists and what is signed; changes nothing
    ... -Remove    delete the certificate and untrust it (signatures stay, unverifiable)
