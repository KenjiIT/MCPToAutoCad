#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
  THE LEDGER MUST NOT CONTRADICT THE EVIDENCE BESIDE IT.

  docs/STRUCTURAL-PROGRAM-STATE.json emitted, for weeks:

      "multiversion": null,
      "multiversion_means": "null because no other Revit year has been opened
       for this path. Compilation is proved on five years; BEHAVIOUR is proved
       on the year above and no other."

  It went on emitting that sentence after five years HAD been measured and
  docs/evidence/structure-matrix.json had been committed saying so. Two files in
  the same repository, describing the same product, saying opposite things -
  and the ledger is the one people read first.

  It was not a bug in the sense of a crash. It was a hard-coded null with a
  hard-coded explanation, which is exactly the shape of thing that survives
  every test that only checks the generator RUNS. These tests check what it
  SAYS, against artifacts they control.

  The second half of the file is about cleanliness. `rollup_repo_clean: false`
  with nothing beside it tells a reader the tree was dirty and refuses to say
  how, so the only safe reading left is the worst one - that product code was
  uncommitted when the numbers were taken. The classification must survive.
