  Live verification against a REAL Revit.

  CI cannot do this: a hosted runner has no RevitAPI.dll and no Revit process, so
  everything that matters most - the UI-thread round trip, the guards, the
  refusals - is exactly what CI cannot prove. This is the other half of the test
  story, and it is meant to run against every Revit generation before a release.

  It reports what it MEASURED. A probe that is not exercised is reported as "not
  covered" rather than quietly counted as working.

  THE DEFAULT TIER IS NON-DESTRUCTIVE. The write commands are exercised through
  their refusals and their dry runs, which is where their guarantees live: a
  refusal that fires is proof, and it changes nothing. Nothing in the default run
  writes to a model.

  AND THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. Three typed commands reached review with 411 green
  unit tests, zero warnings, and their apply paths never once executed - and not
  one of them could do its job: heads landed on the project origin, a riser never
  got past its tee, and a connection that Revit really made was reported as
  failed. Refusals prove the guards. Dry runs prove the arithmetic. Only a commit
  proves the command.

  So there is a second tier, behind -WriteProbes, that COMMITS. It runs against a
  model the fixtures file names as disposable and it never saves. See the
  WriteDocument fixture. Without the switch and that fixture, every probe in it is
  NOT COVERED by name - which is the same treatment every other missing guarantee
  gets here, and the reason this gap was visible at all.

  A -WriteProbes RUN IS ITS OWN RUN. The write tier needs WriteDocument ACTIVE,
  and every -Document-targeted probe then refuses against the front document -
  so either point -Document at the disposable model for that run, or accept the
  main tier reporting refusals. The two tiers green in ONE run needs one model
  to be both the fixture document and the disposable one.

  THE WRITE TIER IS NOT REPEATABLE AGAINST THE SAME OPEN DOCUMENT. Its first run
  consumes what it needs: once heads are placed on every free stub, a second run
  correctly reports that no position matches, which reads like a regression and is
  not one. Close the disposable model without saving and reopen it between runs.

  Usage:
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2026
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2026 -Document MOD_ARCH_A
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2024 -OldFile path\to\a-2023.rfa

    # the release gate: every fixture supplied, provenance checked, JSON emitted
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2026 -ReleaseGate `
         -ExpectedCommit <sha> -Json artifacts/live-2026.json

    # the write tier: COMMITS into the model the fixtures file declares disposable
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2026 -WriteProbes

    # plus the opt-in ISO 19650 case that writes the delivery code into that
    # disposable model to prove deliverable_ready=true (live-iso19650.probes.ps1)
    pwsh scripts/verify-live.ps1 -Year 2026 -WriteProbes -IsoReadyProbe

  Requires: that Revit open with the add-in loaded.

  WHERE THE FIXTURE NAMES COME FROM. The parameters below name real things on
  this machine - a model title, a second model, a shared-parameter file and a
  definition inside it, a category, a file saved by another Revit year. Putting
  them in the repository or in CI variables would publish client and project
  names, which is a leak this project refuses to create. So they are
  read from a file OUTSIDE the repository:

      %USERPROFILE%\.horizun\live-fixtures.json

  An explicit parameter always wins over the file. A fixture that is absent from
  both makes its probes NOT COVERED - named in the output and, under
  -ReleaseGate, a non-zero exit.

  EXIT CODES
    0  every probe passed and nothing was left uncovered
    1  at least one probe FAILED
    2  at least one probe was UNVERIFIED - its check could not run
    3  something was NOT COVERED - a guarantee this run did not even attempt
       (exit 3 only under -ReleaseGate; a developer run prints the list and exits 0)

  Three is not a lesser two. A guarantee missing from the output reads exactly
  like one that passed, which is why it has its own code rather than a warning.

        #
        # "No command reports work it did not verify" is honoured everywhere. What
        # happens AFTER a failure was the part with no live evidence: one command
        # rolls back and builds nothing, another commits and leaves the attempt in
        # the model with an honest sentence about it. Both are truthful; only one is
        # safe to retry.
        #
        # This used to be inferred - scan whatever answers the tier happened to
        # collect for a fully_verified=false that had committed anyway. That went
        # UNVERIFIED the moment the commands it leaned on left the surface, because
        # it was watching for a failure rather than causing one.
        #
        # So it is PROVOKED. horizun_execute_plan composes typed writes into one
        # TransactionGroup and documents that any failure rolls the complete graph
        # back. Both actions below rehearse cleanly against the same real pipe: first
        # delete it, then pin it. During execution the delete commits inside the group,
        # so the transform reaches an element that no longer exists and fails THERE,
        # after the group and a real write. The pipe count before/after must be identical.
        #
        # It was anchored on walls first and went UNVERIFIED on the real fixture -
        # HZ_WRITE is an HVAC model and offers no wall type. Anchoring a probe on a
        # category the fixture does not have is the probe's bug, not the product's,
