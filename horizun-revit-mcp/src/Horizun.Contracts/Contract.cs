// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// ONE declaration of what this bridge offers, shared by both halves.
//
// The server carried the tool table; each command carried its own Name,
// Description and ParametersSchema. The same facts, written twice, by hand. They
// drifted twice in a single afternoon of work here: a parameter added to the
// server schema and not to the command's, and a description updated on one side
// while the other kept promising the old behaviour. Nothing detected either -
// the two copies never meet.
//
// So the contract lives here, once, and is LINKED into the server and the add-in.
// Neither can restate it, because neither owns it.
//
// It also carries a hash of itself. The add-in publishes that hash in its
// discovery file and the server compares it before forwarding anything, so two
// builds that disagree about what a command takes are a refusal with a sentence
// rather than an argument silently ignored at the far end.
//
// No Autodesk types and no server types: it compiles into both.

If any of that happened, or links were excluded or unloaded, the result is PARTIAL rather than clean â€” a zero from this tool means zero. Read-only. With plan_penetrations=true each qualifying pair (exactly one MEP curve) additionally becomes a penetration plan - crossing point with its basis, direction, measured cross-section, wall-opening rectangle or sleeve placement - emitted as next_arguments for horizun_create_elements; refusals (linked host, structural host without opt-in, near-vertical run, unreadable section) are named per row.",

WHAT IS PLANNED is decided by REPRESENTATION, never by class name: a wall with an Axis polyline is a Revit wall, and a wall exported as a faceted BREP is a lump of geometry with the word wall on it. The subset: WALLS from an Axis 2-point polyline, at the height their body extrusion measures; COLUMNS at their placement point, rotated by the placement plan angle, refused when the placement is tilted out of plan; BEAMS from an Axis 2-point polyline; SLABS from a vertical extrusion of a horizontal polygon, HOLES INCLUDED; OPENINGS as wall openings when rectangular and not filled - a door cuts its own hole, and cutting both cuts the wall twice; DOORS and WINDOWS as hosted instances at the centre of the opening they fill, because several exporters put a door placement on its hinge side. THE INVENTORY IS THE DELIVERABLE AS MUCH AS THE PLAN: every class is counted and judged against a CLOSED, printed table, and every skipped element is NAMED with the representation that caused it - an importer whose report lists only what it managed is one that drops a third of a building without anybody noticing.

(2) THE HOST RESOLUTION: an opening cannot name the wall it is cut into and a door cannot name the wall it hangs in, because those elements do not exist until the stage before them commits; the plan names the IFC entity and this substitutes the real id, from what it just created or from what an earlier run left behind. A host it cannot resolve STOPS the stage rather than cutting a hole in whatever wall happened to be there. (3) THE PROVENANCE: every created element is stamped in Extensible Storage with its IFC GlobalId, class, representation and the file hash - invisible in the UI, and the only reason a second run is an update instead of a second building perfectly aligned with the first.

                Description = @"Split compound walls into ONE SINGLE-LAYER WALL PER MATERIAL LAYER, each at the physical position its layer occupied inside the assembly. THE ORIGINAL WALL IS NOT DELETED: it is converted into the single-layer wall of the CORE, so it keeps its ElementId and UniqueId, and every door, window, hosted family, opening, sweep, reveal and embedded curtain wall stays hosted in it - with ITS own ElementId and UniqueId, its parameters, its sill and head heights, its phase, its workset and its nested subcomponents. Only the other layers are created. N layers WITH VOLUME produce exactly N walls; a zero-width membrane keeps its layer number, is reported as not materialised, and does not renumber the layers behind it. THE CORE IS NOT 'the first Structure layer': the core range comes from the compound structure's own core boundaries, and the carrier is the structural layer inside it, or the thickest one, or the thickest core layer when none is structural - ties broken by lowest original index, and the reason reported. A wall with no valid core is REFUSED, never silently hosted on layer 0. Offsets are computed from the layer widths AND the wall's actual location line - all six of WallCenterline, CoreCenterline, FinishFaceExterior, FinishFaceInterior, CoreExterior and CoreInterior - so a wall drawn on its exterior face is not displaced by half its thickness. The exterior direction is MEASURED off the wall's exterior shell face rather than deduced. STRAIGHT AND CIRCULAR-ARC walls are supported; an arc keeps its centre, angles and sense and only its radius changes. Splines, ellipses and degenerate curves are refused by name, never straightened. Refused with an explicit code and nothing written: stacked walls, curtain walls, slanted or tapered walls, walls with an edited profile, attached walls, walls in a group or a design option, walls owned by another user, and any dependency whose equivalence cannot be guaranteed. EACH WALL IS ITS OWN ATOM: it runs in its own SubTransaction and is committed only after the model is re-read - each layer's position measured against its planned offset within 0.5 mm, each resulting type re-read and confirmed single-layer and correctly named, every insert checked by ElementId, UniqueId, host, symbol, placement, flips, level, phase, subcomponents and parameters, and every secondary layer ray-cast at each insert to prove the opening passes through. Anything that fails rolls that wall back WHOLE, leaving it exactly as it was, while the rest of the batch keeps its verified conversions. Type names follow [ORIGINAL TYPE] - [MATERIAL] - [NN] with NN the original layer position counted from the exterior, and a name already taken by a different composition gets a deterministic variant rather than being overwritten; no existing type is ever modified. Provenance is stamped in Extensible Storage, so a second identical call answers already_split instead of duplicating. The confirmation token binds EACH WALL individually - type, compound structure, location line, curve, flip, constraints and dependencies - so a model that moved refuses as stale. Only Revit's walls-overlap warning is suppressed, matched by FailureDefinitionId and not by localised text; any other warning comes back and takes all_verified down with it. originals_deleted is 0 by design. dry_run defaults to TRUE.",

View-specific elements, elements with no category, and elements already inside a group are now excluded up front and listed per candidate in 'excluded', so the rest still groups. Second, it cleared the parameter AFTER creating the group; writing a parameter on an element that is already a group member is precisely what raises Revit's group modal, and an unanswered modal holds Revit's UI thread until the caller times out. The stamp is now cleared BEFORE the group is created - same end state, no modal, and a failed grouping rolls the clearing back with it.

IT REFUSES RATHER THAN APPROXIMATES, and this is the point of the tool: it works only on straight Basic Walls, and a curved wall, a non-rectangular opening, or any profile it cannot rebuild stably is reported BY NAME with its reason in 'refused' - nothing is guessed at. A wall that is already rectangular is listed in 'already_rectangular' and left alone; that is a correct outcome, not a failure, and it is kept separate from the refusals so the two are never confused. Each wall is rebuilt inside its OWN SubTransaction, so one that defeats the rebuild rolls back alone, is reported in 'errors', and the rest of the batch still applies. Revit's overlap, join and identical-instance warnings are suppressed because rebuilding a wall as fragments raises them by construction; every other warning reaches you. Fragments below a minimum dimension or area are dropped and counted in fragments_skipped_tiny rather than created as slivers. VERIFIED AFTER THE COMMIT: fragments_present re-reads every new id and confirms it is a Wall - a SubTransaction that committed still dies with the outer one, so counting what was built inside it is not evidence. dry_run defaults to TRUE.",
