// horizun_acc_upload_status - has each of these files been assigned a cloud
// folder yet, or is its upload still pending? (story 5.15)
//
// Publishing to ACC through the Desktop Connector is copy + wait: the copy
// lands in the local cache and the upload happens later, asynchronously, and
// fails under throttling ("Too many people or processes...", ~11-minute
// circuit breaker). Measured in the field: 3 of 8 families silently
// unuploaded while every local hash checked out - the local cache is exactly
// what a hash proves, and the cloud is exactly what it does not. The one
// local record that answers the question is the connector's own WAL, and
// until this command the only way to read it was an external script.
//
// Read-only over files the connector owns. The parsing and matching rules are
// AccUploadWal (Revit-free, unit-tested); this file is the IO: find the WAL
// files, read them WITHOUT demanding exclusive access (the connector holds
// them open - the same share-mode lesson family_apply's save proof paid for),
// and say per file when one could not be read, because a count over a partial
// read must never present itself as a count over the log.
