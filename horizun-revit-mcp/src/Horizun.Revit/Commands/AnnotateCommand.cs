// Horizun Revit MCP - text, tags and dimensions with explicit references.
//
// THE DIMENSION OPERATIONS ARE PRODUCTION WRITES, and this file holds them to
// the same bar as transform and write_params:
//
//   * a dry run does not merely validate arguments - it CREATES every annotation
//     provisionally in one transaction, regenerates, measures the result, and
//     rolls back, reporting the rollback status Revit actually returned. What a
//     caller approves is a batch Revit has already demonstrated it can build,
//     with the measured values in hand;
//   * the materialised plan binds the view, the EFFECTIVE dimension type
//     (explicit or the document default resolved now - a default swapped between
//     rehearsal and apply is a stale plan), every reference reserialized with
//     its owner, its subgeometry kind and a 0.1 mm geometry fingerprint, the
//     requested line, and the value the rehearsal measured;
//   * the apply runs inside a TransactionGroup: create, regenerate, verify every
//     postcondition while the transaction is still reversible, commit only when
//     all of them hold, re-read everything again after the commit, and only then
//     assimilate. Any failure rolls the WHOLE batch back and the response
//     carries the real TransactionStatus of every rollback - uncertain when
//     Revit did not confirm one, never a claimed-clean model;
//   * verification is per field: requested / read / match, with the comparison
//     tolerance named. There is no bare verified=true for a dimension.
//
// Operations whose API does not exist in this Revit (radial/diameter/arc length
// before 2025, spot slope everywhere) refuse with an ORDINARY planning error on
// purpose, never UnsupportedCapability: that type grants the Python fallback,
// and Python cannot call a class that is absent from RevitAPI.dll either.
