// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_apply_cad_plan — build the plan, but only if it still means what it
// meant when it was made.
//
// THIS COMMAND DOES NOT CREATE ELEMENTS. It resolves and calls the real
// horizun_create_elements, exactly as horizun_execute_plan does, so every
// rehearsal, confirmation token, transaction and post-commit re-read is the one
// this bridge already has. Writing a second creation path for CAD would double
// the surface that has to be trusted and halve the evidence for it.
//
// What it ADDS, and could not be got any other way:
//
//   THE BINDING. A plan is made against a drawing at a moment: those bytes, that
//   transform, that requirement set. Between the plan and the apply, someone can
//   reload the link, receive a new issue of the DWG, nudge the import, or edit a
//   rule. All four produce a plan aimed at a different building, and all four
//   are silent. This re-measures the source, the transform and the set hash, and
//   refuses stale_plan naming WHICH one moved.
//
//   THE ORDER. Stages run in dependency order, and a stage that fails stops the
//   ones after it rather than building doors for walls that never landed.
//
//   THE PROVENANCE. Every element created is stamped, in Extensible Storage,
//   with the CAD entity it came from, the rule that decided it, the requirement
//   set's identity and the plan's fingerprint. Without that, the second run has
//   no way to know what the first one built, and "update the model from the new
//   drawing" is not a thing anyone can do.
//
//   THE HONEST PARTIAL. Stages commit separately - a 4000-element conversion in
//   one transaction is a conversion nobody can recover from - so this reports
//   `partial` with exactly which stages landed, and never claims atomicity it
//   does not have.
