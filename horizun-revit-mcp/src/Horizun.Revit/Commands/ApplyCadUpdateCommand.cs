// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_apply_cad_update - carry out an incremental plan AND remember it.
//
// The update could be sent through horizun_execute_plan, and for one run it would
// work. The second run is the problem: elements created that way carry no
// provenance, so the next update reads them as things the drawing asks for and
// nothing has built, and creates them AGAIN. Measured live, 2026-08-27 - two
// walls where the drawing shows one.
//
// So this command exists for the same reason horizun_apply_cad_plan does. It
// creates nothing itself: creates go through the typed horizun_create_elements
// and re-shapes through the typed horizun_transform_elements, both of which
// rehearse, confirm and re-read their own work. What it adds is the memory - a
// provenance stamp on everything it touches, carrying the entity, the rule, the
// requirement set, and the geometry AS BUILT, read back off the element after
// the commit rather than off the request.
