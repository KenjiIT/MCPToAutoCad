// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_apply_ifc_plan — build the plan horizun_plan_from_ifc produced, but only
// if it still means what it meant when it was made.
//
// THIS COMMAND CREATES NOTHING ITSELF. It resolves and calls the real
// horizun_create_elements, exactly as horizun_apply_cad_plan does, so every
// rehearsal, confirmation token, transaction and post-commit re-read is the one
// this bridge already has. A second creation path for IFC would double the
// surface that has to be trusted and halve the evidence for it.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS, and none of it could be got any other way:
//
//   THE BINDING. A plan is made against a file at a moment: those bytes, that
//   unit scale, those resolved types and levels. Between the plan and the apply
//   somebody can receive a new issue of the IFC, rename a wall type, delete the
//   level the plan resolved, or edit the actions in transit. All four aim the
//   plan at a different building and all four are silent. This re-hashes the
//   file, re-reads every resolved id by name, re-fingerprints the actions, and
//   refuses stale_plan naming WHICH one moved — before writing anything.
//
//   THE HOST RESOLUTION. An opening cannot name the wall it is cut into, and a
//   door cannot name the wall it hangs in, because those elements do not exist
//   until the stage before them commits. The plan carries host_global_id; this
//   substitutes the real host_id from what it has just created — or, on a second
//   run, from the provenance an earlier run left in the model.
//
//   THE PROVENANCE. Every created element is stamped with the IFC GlobalId, the
//   class, the representation used and the file's hash. Without it the second run
//   has no way to know what the first one built, and "update the model from the
//   new IFC" is not a thing anyone can do — a re-run would produce a second
//   building perfectly aligned with the first.
//
//   THE HONEST PARTIAL. Stages commit separately, because a four-thousand element
//   import in one transaction is an import nobody can recover from. So this
//   reports `partial` with exactly which stages landed and never claims an
//   atomicity it does not have.
