// Horizun Revit MCP - measuring a model for accessibility and egress.
// Original Horizun code. READ-ONLY.
//
// G22 of the 2026-09-14 competitive inventory. The rule ARITHMETIC and the whole
// argument about what may and may not be claimed live in Core/AccessRules.cs,
// which knows no building code and never will. This file does the measuring.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES, AND HOW HONEST EACH NUMBER IS - stated per row, because the
// three are not equally trustworthy and presenting them identically would be the
// defect:
//
//   DOOR CLEAR WIDTH. Read from the instance's own width parameter, falling back
//   to the type's. It is the NOMINAL leaf width, and the row says so: real clear
//   width subtracts the leaf thickness and the stop, and a door that opens 90
//   degrees is not the same as one that opens 180. A nominal width is the right
//   number to triage on and the wrong number to certify with.
//
//   STAIR GEOMETRY. Riser and tread are Revit's own ACTUAL values, and width is
//   the narrowest of the stair's runs - a stair is as wide as its pinch point.
//   These are the most trustworthy rows here.
//
//   RAMP SLOPE. The TYPE'S DECLARED MAXIMUM, and nothing better is available:
//   checked against the installed RevitAPI.dll, a Revit ramp exposes no as-built
//   slope, height or width parameter. A ramp drawn steeper than its type permits
//   is therefore invisible to this row, and the row says so rather than passing
//   the type's constraint off as a measurement.
//
//   DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST EXIT. A STRAIGHT LINE from the room's location point
//   to the nearest door marked as an exit. It goes through walls. Every row says
//   so, and the value is labelled straight_line_mm rather than travel_distance.
//   SINCE 2026-09-15 IT IS NO LONGER THE ONLY NUMBER: pass route_view_id and a REAL
//   travel distance is computed with Revit's own path-of-travel service, around the
//   obstacles that plan shows. "The API exposes no property for it" was true and was
//   never the same statement as "it cannot be obtained",
//   because the second word would be a lie that reads as a measurement.
//
// WHICH DOORS ARE EXITS IS THE CALLER'S TO SAY. Nothing in a Revit model reliably
// marks an exit; a project might use a parameter, a mark prefix, or a family
// name. So the caller declares the rule, and if they declare none the command
// REFUSES the egress half rather than guessing - a guessed exit set produces
// egress distances that are confidently wrong.
