// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.

// horizun_audit_cad_model - does this model still agree with this drawing?
//
// READ-ONLY, and that is the point rather than a limitation. An audit that could
// change what it measures cannot be used as evidence, and "the drawing and the
// model disagree" is a sentence somebody has to act on with judgement: deleting
// an element because a DWG no longer shows it is a decision about somebody's
// deliverable, not a tidy-up.
//
// It reads the drawing exactly as horizun_plan_from_cad does - same harvest,
// same requirement set, same interpretation - so a finding here and a plan there
// are talking about the same entities under the same names.
