// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_bind_shared_param — bind a shared parameter from an SPF, and PROVE the
// binding that actually ended up in the document.
//
// This is the precondition for the whole per-diameter coding mechanism (an
// earlier scripted approach relied on a shared parameter as an InstanceBinding
// in PG_IDENTITY_DATA, before a single value is written) and it runs once per
// model across large multi-model batches. Today it is one try/except with a
// `break` in it, and it can tell three separate lies — each of which has cost
// real work:
//
//   1. ReInsert with ONLY the new categories DROPS the categories that were
//      already bound, and their values go with them. The default here is to UNION
//      the existing bound categories with the new ones, and — this is the part
//      that matters — the response reports the categories READ BACK from
//      ParameterBindings, never the ones the caller asked for. Echoing the request
//      is precisely how the drop stays invisible: the report looks identical
//      whether ReInsert kept the other categories or threw them away.
//   2. Immediately after Insert/ReInsert the iterator's Key hands back the
//      ExternalDefinition, which has NO VariesAcrossGroups at all. The flag lives
//      on the InternalDefinition, reachable only through a real element's
//      parameter (pp.Definition) after doc.Regenerate() — which itself requires an
//      OPEN transaction. The existing code loops the collector and `break`s on the
//      first hit, so when NO element carries the parameter yet it silently sets
//      nothing and says nothing.
//   3. Without SetAllowVaryBetweenGroups(true), Revit raises the DESAGRUPAR modal
//      the first time two instances inside a Model Group get different values —
//      and a modal does not wait for a human here, it HANGS THE BRIDGE. This is a
//      standing rule learned from exactly that failure, not a preference. The
//      `except: pass` around it today means it can fail while the script sails
//      on, and the bill arrives much later, mid-write, far from the cause.
//
// So the contract: after Regenerate + commit, re-read ParameterBindings
// .ForwardIterator() and report (a) whether the resulting binding really IS an
// InstanceBinding or a TypeBinding, from the object's own type, (b) the real
// resulting category list, and (c) VariesAcrossGroups off the InternalDefinition.
// If any of those three could not be MEASURED, this handler may not report
// success — it names which one and why. "I could not look" is its own outcome
// here (`unknown`), never a bool defaulting to false.
