// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_cad_connect — carry out the junctions a network reading found.
//
// This is the last step of the DWG-to-BIM route and the one that was missing.
// horizun_plan_from_cad and horizun_apply_cad_plan build the pipes; until this
// command existed, they were pipes that touched. Nothing flowed, no system
// spanned them, a schedule counted fourteen pieces where the drawing showed one
// run, and the model looked finished.
//
// TWO KINDS OF JUNCTION, HANDLED IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES, on purpose.
//
//   DIRECT       two collinear ends that the drawing split and Revit should
//                simply join. No fitting belongs there. horizun_connect_mep does
//                exactly this, with every precondition measured and the join
//                re-read from the model afterwards.
//
//   A FITTING    an elbow, a tee, a cross. Revit has a factory for each and
//                horizun_create_elements drives them, with a rehearsal, an
//                atomic batch and a re-read.
//
// BOTH ARE DELEGATED, and this command writes nothing itself. What it adds is the
// step neither of them can do: a drawing names a junction by a POINT, and both of
// those commands take an element and a CONNECTOR INDEX. Turning one into the
// other - and REFUSING when two of an element's connectors are equally near,
// rather than taking whichever comparison won - is the whole of what is here.
// A second writer would be a second set of rules about when a connection is
// legitimate, and the two would drift.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It will not connect a junction the network reading marked
// for review — an irregular three-way, an elevation change, a degree no fitting
// covers. Those arrive here with automatic=false and are reported as skipped
// with the reading's own sentence, because the reason they need a person does
// not stop being true when the call is made again.
//
// It will not connect a CROSSING. A crossing is two lines that meet in plan and
// not in the building; horizun_cad_networks never proposes one, and a caller who
// hand-writes one gets the same refusal as everything else that was not drawn.
