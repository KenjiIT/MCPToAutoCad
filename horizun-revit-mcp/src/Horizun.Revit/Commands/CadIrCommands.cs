// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// THREE READ-ONLY TOOLS OVER ONE READING.
//
//   horizun_cad_extract        what this reading of the drawing contains, and —
//                              the half that did not exist before — what the
//                              reader could NOT reach, axis by axis, with the
//                              evidence for each verdict.
//
//   horizun_cad_networks       the same drawing read as MEP: straight runs,
//                              the junctions between them, the fittings those
//                              junctions imply, and every crossing and gap that
//                              was deliberately NOT joined.
//
//   horizun_cad_unit_instances repeated layouts: which regions of the drawing
//                              are the same unit under a rigid transform, and
//                              which only look like it.
//
// None of the three writes anything. None opens a transaction. Between them they
// answer the question somebody has to answer before converting a permit set:
// what is in here, what connects to what, and what repeats.
//
// WHY EXTRACT EXISTS AT ALL, given that horizun_query_cad already reports layers
// and geometry. Because "the drawing has no text" and "this reader cannot see
// text" were, until the intermediate representation, the same reply — and they
// lead to opposite decisions. One means the information is not there. The other
// means go and get a reader that can see it. Every count this tool publishes
// travels with the sentence that says which kind of zero it is.
