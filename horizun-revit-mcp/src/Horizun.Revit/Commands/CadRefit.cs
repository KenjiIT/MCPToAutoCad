// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// REFIT: a fitting whose runs change section, rebuilt at the new section - or not at all.
//
// MEASURED (campaign 6): writing a new width and height on both legs of an elbow left the
// elbow at the old size and Revit inserted a transition on each leg. That is what Revit does
// on its own; it is not what the drawing shows (one elbow at the new size). A refit replaces
// the fitting: it is deleted, the runs take their new section, and a fitting of the SAME kind
// is placed between the same runs - through the three typed commands that own those writes
// (horizun_delete_verified, horizun_write_params_verified, horizun_create_elements), each
// rehearsed and re-read by itself. This file adds the order, the viability test, the check
// afterwards, and the one thing none of them can do: undo all three together.
//
// A REFIT IS KEPT ONLY WHOLE. The three writes happen inside one transaction group. The group
// is kept only when the new fitting joins every run at the junction, has the new section at
// every end, and every run's OTHER connections are exactly what they were. Anything else - a
// step refused, a step failing, a check not met - rolls the group back and says which.
//
// NOT VIABLE, SAID BEFORE ANYTHING IS WRITTEN: a fitting joined to another fitting (Revit's
// transitions already there, a chain), a run of it not being resized, a round run, a kind this
// route does not place (a transition, a tap), or two runs asked for different sections.
