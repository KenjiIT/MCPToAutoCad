//
// horizun_clash — clash detection that includes linked models.
//
// The handler this replaces has 447 lines and not one mention of RevitLink. It
// only ever collects from the host document.
//
// That is not a missing feature, it is a wrong answer. On a real project the
// structure is one model and the MEP is a link — that is the whole point of
// links, and it is exactly the pair you run clash detection on. Ask the old
// handler for walls vs. ducts, get "0 clashes", and read it as "coordinated".
// It never says the ducts were in a file it did not open. Silence that reads as
// a pass is the most expensive kind of wrong: nobody investigates a clean report.
//
// So this handler:
//   * Collects from the host AND from every loaded RVT link, transforming link
//     geometry into host coordinates (GetTotalTransform — a link is placed with
//     a transform, and comparing untransformed link solids against host solids
//     produces confident nonsense).
//   * Names the source of every element in every clash: "host" or the link.
//   * REFUSES to report a clean result it cannot stand behind. If links exist
//     and were excluded, or a link is unloaded, or geometry failed on elements
//     we were asked to check, that goes in `coverage` and the headline says the
//     result is partial. A zero from this tool means zero, or it says why not.
