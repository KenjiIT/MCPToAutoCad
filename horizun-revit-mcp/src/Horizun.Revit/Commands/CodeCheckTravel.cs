// Horizun Revit MCP - horizun_code_check, egress travel distance. Original Horizun code.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. A rule "max travel distance <= N m" could never pass or fail
// through the requirement-set grammar: Core/CodeCheckEvaluation.cs answered
// not_decidable for travel_distance_m, always. Two entry points now measure it with
// Revit's own Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis.PathOfTravel service (present with the same
// members in every year 2023-2027, read from each year's RevitAPI.xml):
//
//   operation=check        each rule whose measure is travel_distance_m and whose OWN
//                          config names route_view_id(s) and exits gets a routed number
//                          per room, under that rule's own key, BEFORE the pure evaluator
//                          runs (AttachTravelDistance). A rule without a config borrows
//                          nothing and stays not_decidable.
//   operation=travel_distance
//                          the measurement itself, per room, with its polyline, the exit
//                          reached and a verdict against travel.max_m; create_paths=true
//                          keeps one PathOfTravel element per room in the plan for review
//                          (dry_run -> confirmation_token -> apply, re-read after commit).
//
// MEASURING OPENS NO TRANSACTION AT ALL. FindShortestPaths, FindEndsOfShortestPaths
// and FindStartsOfLongestPathsFromRooms are computations: nothing is created, so
// there is nothing to roll back. Only create_paths writes.
//
// THE FARTHEST POINT, HONESTLY. FindStartsOfLongestPathsFromRooms has no room argument
// and returns the worst point(s) of the WHOLE plan. Per room, candidates are routed
// instead (Core/EgressTravelRules.cs says why corners): boundary corners pulled 300 mm
// toward the room's point - each kept only if Revit's own room lookup still puts it in
// THIS room - the room's point, and any whole-plan longest start inside the room. The
// longest routed candidate is a LOWER bound on the room's number, reported as one: a
// certain fail above the limit. A pass needs a proven ceiling (EgressTravelRules.
// UpperBound), which exists only for a convex room of straight walls, no island, and
// every candidate routed; a candidate that found no route is counted and named.
//
// ONE LEVEL, ONE PHASE, NO CROP, STATED. The service is two-dimensional and flattens
// every destination's Z onto the view's level, so exits are filtered to the plan's own
// level and a level with no matching exit is not_assessable (egress via a stair). The
// plan's obstacles are its phase's and its design options', so a room of another phase
// or of a secondary option is out of scope. An active crop box makes Revit ignore what
// lies outside it (PointOutsideActiveCrop, ResultAffectedByCrop) and makes Create throw,
// so a cropped plan is refused before anything is measured.
