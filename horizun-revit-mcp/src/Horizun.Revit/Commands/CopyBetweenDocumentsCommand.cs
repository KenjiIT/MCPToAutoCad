// Horizun Revit MCP - copying elements from one open document into this one.
// Original Horizun code.
//
// G21 of the 2026-09-14 competitive inventory, the half that was missing. The
// DWG-to-BIM half is extensive already (query_cad, plan_from_cad, apply_cad_plan,
// plan_cad_update, apply_cad_update, audit_cad_model, manage_cad_links); what
// nothing could do was copy between two Revit documents.
// ElementTransformUtils.CopyElements appeared once in the whole tree, and only in
// its single-document form.
//
// THE DIRECTION IS FIXED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. This bridge's central guard is
// that a write goes to the ACTIVE document and nowhere else - every typed command
// refuses a target that is not active, because "the right edit in the wrong model"
// is the failure nobody notices until much later. A copy has two documents, so
// the rule is applied to the one being written: THE DESTINATION IS THE ACTIVE
// DOCUMENT, always, and the source is read. Copying "out" into a model somebody
// else has open would be exactly the write this bridge exists to refuse.
//
// WHAT REVIT DOES THAT A CALLER MUST BE TOLD ABOUT. CopyElements brings the
// TYPES with it, and Revit CANNOT rename one on the way in: DuplicateTypeAction
// has exactly two members, Abort and UseDestinationTypes - checked against the
// installed RevitAPI.dll rather than remembered. So a wall type named
// "Basic Wall - 200" that already exists in the destination with different layers
// leaves one real choice: take the destination's type, and accept that nothing
// compared their layers, or refuse the copy. Refusing is the default, and the
// reply names every type that DID arrive - measured as the difference in the
// destination's type set, not reported by the copy.
//
// AMBIGUITY REFUSES BEFORE WRITING. A source element whose category the
// destination does not have, a view-specific element copied without its view, a
// hosted element whose host is not coming along - each is measured and named
// first, because all three produce something that looks copied and is not.
//
// source_path (2026-09-25 field session): a library .rvt/.rte is USUALLY not
// open anywhere - it lives on a share, not in anyone's session - so requiring
// an open source shut out the exact files this exists for. source_path opens
// one in the BACKGROUND, shares the SAME version guard horizun_open_document
// uses (a file from another Revit year is refused, never silently upgraded),
// ALWAYS detaches (this is a read, never a worksharing session), and is closed
// WITHOUT SAVING before this command returns on every exit path - success,
// refusal or exception alike. Because ids from a document that was never open
// cannot be known ahead of time, type_names resolves by NAME instead: each name
// must match exactly one ElementType in the source (category narrows a
// collision), so what gets copied is what was named, not a guess among several.
