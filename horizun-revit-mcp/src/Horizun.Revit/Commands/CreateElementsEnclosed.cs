// Horizun Revit MCP - horizun_create_elements, placement='all_enclosed'. Original
// Horizun code.
//
// One room (or space) in every closed region of a level IN A PHASE that does not
// already hold one. The entry is EXPANDED here, on every call, into one ordinary
// room/space row per region to fill - so the rehearsal lists every region it saw
// (area, Revit's interior point, what will happen to it) and a wall moved between
// rehearsal and apply resolves a different plan, which the token refuses as stale.
//
// ROOMS: the regions are Revit's PlanTopology(level, phase) circuits, each with
// PlanCircuit.IsRoomLocated; a room goes in with NewRoom(Phase) + NewRoom(Room,
// PlanCircuit) - the circuit itself, no point guessing. Per circuit and not
// NewRooms2, because NewRooms2 fills EVERY empty circuit in one call and a caller's
// min_area (the shafts nobody wants a room in) could only be honoured by creating
// and then deleting.
//
// SPACES: space regions are bounded by SPACE separators, not room separators, so the
// room topology is not theirs. The regions are the ones Revit's own NewSpaces2(level,
// phase, floor plan) fills, read in a rolled-back transaction; each is then placed
// with NewSpace(Level, Phase, UV) at the point Revit itself chose (the API has no
// NewSpace(Space, PlanCircuit)). Spaces that already stand on the level in that phase
// are listed as occupied beside them.
//
// Reading PlanTopology needs a MODIFIABLE document - Revit computes the topology on
// first access (RevitAPI.xml, Document.PlanTopology) - and NewSpaces2 writes, so both
// run inside a transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back; only plain values leave it.
// NewRoom(Room, PlanCircuit) throws when the level has no view, and NewSpaces2 tags
// into one, so a level without a floor plan is refused by name before anything runs.
//
// PlanCircuit exposes an area, a side count and ONE interior point - no centroid and
// no boundary. The rehearsal says point_inside, never centroid.
//
// NOT PROVEN and NOT MEASURED by this build or its live probe: whether walls of a
// LINKED model marked Room Bounding close a region of the host. The reply says so.
