// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// ONE OVERLOAD DOES NOT PLACE EVERY FAMILY.
//
// MEASURED, on Revit 2026.4 and the imperial electrical template:
//
//   Duplex Receptacle / GFCI          WorkPlaneBased   work_plane_based = 1
//   Lighting Switches                 WorkPlaneBased   work_plane_based = 1
//   Data Outlet                       WorkPlaneBased   work_plane_based = 1
//   Panelboard 208V MLO               WorkPlaneBased   work_plane_based = 1
//
// Every one of them was being sent through
// NewFamilyInstance(point, symbol, wall, level, structuralType), which Revit
// ACCEPTS and which returns an instance whose Host is null. It raises nothing.
// The postcondition caught it - the row asked for a host and the committed
// element had none - and twenty-one rows of a real conversion refused.
//
// A work-plane based family is placed on a FACE:
// NewFamilyInstance(Reference face, XYZ location, XYZ referenceDirection, symbol).
// That is what this file does, and everything hard about it is in the four
// questions it has to answer honestly:
//
//   WHICH FACE.  A wall has two sides and they are different walls to whoever
//                lives there. The side is chosen by where the symbol was DRAWN,
//                measured against the face's own outward normal - never by
//                taking whichever face came back first.
//   IS THE POINT ON IT.  A face is bounded. Face.Project gives a UV and
//                Face.IsInside says whether that UV is on the face rather than
//                on its infinite plane, and a point beyond the end of a wall
//                projects happily onto nothing.
//   WHICH WAY.   The reference direction must lie IN the face. The symbol's
//                rotation is a direction in plan; its component in the face
//                plane is the hand. When that component is degenerate - a symbol
//                pointing straight into the wall - the wall's own direction is
//                used and the reply SAYS SO.
//   HOW HIGH.    The drawing has no heights. The Z asked for is kept exactly:
//                the face route places at the point it is given, and a mounting
//                height is the requirement set's statement, not this file's.
