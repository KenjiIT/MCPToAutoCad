// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_delete_verified — the DELETE verb, and the site of the flagship lie.
//
// The incident this file exists to make impossible, in full:
//
//   A batch purge reported "758 types purged". Nothing was purged. Revit had
//   rolled the whole transaction back and Transaction.Commit() returned
//   TransactionStatus.RolledBack WITHOUT throwing. The script had done
//   `doc.Delete(List[ElementId](ids)); total += len(ids)` and printed
//   "Purgados (aprox): 758" — it counted its own Delete() calls. The real cause
//   was that the batch mixed FamilySymbol with WallType/FloorType/RoofType, and
//   one bad element poisoned everything around it.
//
// So this handler refuses the three habits that produced it:
//
//   * IT NEVER COUNTS ITS OWN INPUT. A deletion is counted only when the id
//     fails to re-resolve against the document AFTER the commit. doc.Delete()'s
//     return value is used ONLY to attribute cascades — never as a verdict. It
//     is a statement of intent, and intent is what lied.
//   * IT COMMITS THROUGH Guard.Commit. That single line is what turns the
//     silent RolledBack into an error instead of a success report. Everything
//     else here is detail; that line is the fix.
//   * IT DELETES ONE ID AT A TIME. Batch Delete() returns the union of everything
//     that died with no attribution, so "cascaded_by" off a batch call would be a
//     guess dressed as a measurement. Per-id also means one FamilySymbol among
//     the WallTypes cannot poison the other 757 — the actual mechanism of the
//     incident. It costs API calls and buys the truth.
//
// Purge mode iterates to a REAL fixed point — a pass whose candidate set comes
// back empty — instead of the `for _ in range(3)` a script typically does, or the
// "run Manage > Purge Unused by hand 2-3 times" a human falls back to. Each
// pass is its own transaction (so its count is a real post-commit measurement)
// inside one TransactionGroup (so the user gets one undo step).
//
// And: `converged:false` and `purge_supported:false` are DIFFERENT things, and
// both differ from "nothing to purge". On a Revit without GetUnusedElements we
// say we could not look. We do not say the model is clean. CAD present is
// 🔴 BLOQUEA ENTREGA — a false clean here is the worst report this product can
// emit.
