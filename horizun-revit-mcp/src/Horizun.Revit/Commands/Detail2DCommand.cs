// Horizun Revit MCP - typed, verified 2D detail production.
//
// THE OPERATIONS ARE PRODUCTION WRITES, held to the same bar as annotate,
// transform and write_params:
//
//   * a dry run does not merely validate arguments - it CREATES every element
//     provisionally in one transaction, regenerates, reads the result back, and
//     rolls back, reporting the rollback status Revit actually returned. What a
//     caller approves is a batch Revit has already demonstrated it can build;
//   * the materialised plan binds the view, every resource by identity (line
//     style, filled-region type WITH its IsMasking read from the type, family
//     symbol), the normalized geometry and its deterministic signature
//     (Detail2DRules), the batch order, and what the rehearsal read - a resource
//     or a default swapped between rehearsal and apply is a stale plan;
//   * the apply runs inside a TransactionGroup: create, regenerate, verify every
//     postcondition while the transaction is still reversible, commit, run one
//     materialising regeneration, RE-READ everything from the committed model,
//     and only then assimilate. Any failure rolls the WHOLE batch back and the
//     response carries the real TransactionStatus of every rollback;
//   * verification is per field: requested / read / match, with the comparison
//     tolerance named. Geometry is verified from the AUTHORED facts
//     (GeometryCurve, GetBoundaries, LocationPoint) at every stage; the one fact
//     Revit materialises late - the view bounding box - is declared as such and
//     enforced post-commit, inside the still-open group, where a miss still
//     rolls everything back.
//
// COORDINATE CONVENTION (one convention for every 2D view): a request point
// [x, y] is view-plane coordinates - X along View.RightDirection, Y along
// View.UpDirection, origin at View.Origin - and the model point is
// view.Origin + x*RightDirection + y*UpDirection. A third component must be 0:
// out-of-plane detail is refused, never silently projected.
//
// An operation outside the closed enum refuses as UnsupportedCapability, which
// is what may grant the Python fallback - decided ONCE over the whole batch by
// FallbackDecision, so a mixed batch (one gap, one typo) grants nothing.
// Everything a caller could fix - a non-ViewBased family, a style outside
// GetLineStyleIds, a masking mismatch, an invalid loop - is an ordinary
// argument error on purpose.
