// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_document_session — the PERSIST verb. The guarded superset of
// open_document (which stays; this does not replace it in place).
//
// This is the only tool in the estate whose mistakes cannot be undone. Everything
// else writes into a model you can roll back. This one touches files on disk, and
// two of its failure modes destroy work permanently:
//
//   1. THE UPGRADE. It is normal to run two Revit versions side by side (say
//      2025 and 2026), each with its own host process and its own transport.
//      Opening a 2025 .rfa on the 2026 host upgrades it to 2026 — and
//      there is no downgrade, ever. A whole family library dies to a handler that
//      just calls OpenAndActivateDocument and reports "opened". The current
//      defense is that the agent remembers to eyeball two health calls; the
//      symptom ("'ElementId' object has no attribute 'IntegerValue'") arrives
//      AFTER the file has been touched. So: before opening we read the file's own
//      version off the disk with BasicFileInfo — WITHOUT opening it — read the
//      host's app.VersionNumber, and compare both against a REQUIRED
//      expected_version. Any disagreement is a refusal, not a warning. An upgrade
//      must be typed out by a human as allow_upgrade=true.
//   2. THE SAVE THAT DIDN'T. A family was destroyed once by a SaveAs that got
//      skipped while the delete line ran anyway, because the script's success
//      signal was "SaveAs did not throw" and it printed "OK -> " + newpath. Here,
//      "saved" is never anchored to the absence of an exception: it is anchored to
//      File.Exists plus a size plus an mtime plus a BasicFileInfo that reads back
//      off the filesystem after the write.
//
// Two truths this handler refuses to paper over:
//
//   * AUDIT IS NOT A SAVE OPTION. The Revit API exposes Audit on OpenOptions and
//     nowhere else — SaveOptions/SaveAsOptions have Compact and no Audit. The
//     usual delivery requirement is "a .rvt saved with Audit + Compact", and the
//     honest reading of that is: audited when it was OPENED, compacted when it was
//     SAVED. So audit_ran can only report on the open. If this handler did not
//     perform the open, it does not know, and "unknown" is a DIFFERENT value from
//     false. A handler that returned audit_ran=true off a save would be inventing
//     a flag the API never received.
//   * NO SYNC THE OWNER DID NOT AUTHORISE. operation=sync_with_central exists
//     (DocumentSessionSync.cs) and is OFF by default, gated like execute_python:
//     only the machine owner turns it on, from Revit's Advanced options. It refuses
//     detached copies and models under force_read_only_on_workshared, previews an
//     ESTIMATE, and re-reads ownership and update status after the sync. On a
//     workshared document a save is still a save — of the local, or worse of the
//     central — and it is refused unless force_workshared says otherwise.
//
// Compact's whole point is the delta, so bytes_before/bytes_after are stat-ed from
// the filesystem on both sides. bytes_after == bytes_before after a compact is
// reported as SUSPICIOUS, in the response, not swallowed.
