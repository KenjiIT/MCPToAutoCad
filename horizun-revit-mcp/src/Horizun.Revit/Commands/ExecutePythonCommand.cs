// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// Direct Python against the Revit API, on the UI thread. The standing fallback:
// no set of typed tools ever covers the whole API, this does.
//
// DISABLED BY DEFAULT: when a typed command cannot cover a request, the owner may
// grant persistent access from Revit's Python ON/OFF button until they revoke it,
// or configure the same durable opt-in administratively. It runs arbitrary code inside Revit with the full API
// and the rights of the signed-in user, so the per-machine switch is checked here
// AND in the server, because the two halves ship separately and neither may be
// the only gate.
//
// The standard library ships (IronPython.StdLib), so `import json`, `re`, `csv`,
// `datetime` resolve - no hand-rolling JSON with string joins.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated because this file used to claim the opposite: it
// cannot undo a transaction a script left open. The old code opened a NEW
// Transaction and rolled THAT back, which does nothing to the orphan - the Revit
// API offers no handle on a transaction opened by other code. So the document is
// checked afterwards, and a script that left it modifiable makes the command
// FAIL, with the consequence spelled out. A gesture that looks like a cure is
// worse than a stated limitation.
//
// print() is captured through a Python StringIO, never the runtime's byte
// stream — routing it through Runtime.IO returned UTF-16-as-UTF-8 ("h\0o\0l\0a").

            "THE EXECUTION FALLBACK - runs arbitrary code inside Revit on the UI thread with the full API and " +
            "the rights of the signed-in user. Disabled by default; a machine owner must grant it temporarily " +
            "from Revit or enable it durably, and every explicit off choice is respected. " +
            "WHEN TO USE IT: prefer a typed command whenever one fully covers the operation - typed commands " +
            "rehearse, verify and re-read their work. When no typed capability exists, or a typed command " +
            "refuses BEFORE writing because the operation/kind/category is outside its contract, generate " +
            "minimal Python and run it HERE instead of answering 'not supported'. Do NOT fall back here after " +
            "a typed write FAILED mid-operation - it may have partially written, and a Python retry is a " +
            "second write, not a recovery; report the real state instead. " +
            "REQUIRES target_document, like every other command that can change a model: it is matched against " +
            "the ACTIVE document and refused if they differ, and this command will not switch documents for you. " +
            "A script that needs no document cannot run here. " +
            "preflight=true validates WITHOUT executing: permission, document, size, script SHA-256, basic " +
            "syntax, plus advisory warnings (typed-command overlaps, missing transaction hygiene, no " +
            "__output__). It cannot prove what arbitrary code will do. When the objective is already " +
            "unambiguous and preflight passes, CONTINUE to execution in the same task - preflight is a check, " +
            "not an approval step. " +
            "run_async=true additionally REQUIRES idempotency_key - the reply carrying your job_id is the message " +
            "that gets lost, so a retry needs a way to be recognised as one. The key is bound to the Revit " +
            "process, the target document, a SHA-256 of the code and every other argument: the same key with the " +
            "same request returns the original job_id and queues nothing, the same key with a different request " +
            "is refused. " +
            "IT IS STILL A PRIVILEGED BYPASS: unlike the typed commands it has no dry run, no plan and no " +
            "confirmation token, so nothing rehearses what it will do. That is an accepted risk, not a policy it " +
            "satisfies - see docs/security-model.md. " +

            "a composite script that also needs one of those calls runs fine, and the typed command remains " +
            "the better tool when it is the WHOLE job. " +

            "bound to the idempotency key exactly like inline code. Exactly one of the two. A file makes " +
