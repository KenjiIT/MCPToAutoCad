// Horizun MCP â€” original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_family_apply â€” the whole homologation of ONE .rfa, in ONE transaction.
//
// This replaces an earlier scripted approach that ran over a large family
// library, 2-4 families per call because the bridge cuts at 30 s, and it ended
// with:
//
//     try: fm.AddParameter(ed, gid, inst)
//     except System.Exception: pass
//     ...
//     try: fm.Set(p, u"%s" % it["value"])
//     except System.Exception: pass
//     ...
//     __output__ = "OK -> " + newpath
//
// Every write is wrapped in a bare `except: pass`, and the report is a string
// built from the INPUT. A family can come out saying "OK -> path" with zero
// parameters actually written, and nothing downstream can tell. So:
//
//   * FamilyManager.Set() returns VOID. Unlike Parameter.Set() there is not even
//     a bool to ignore: the ONLY evidence a value landed is reading it back off
//     fm.CurrentType after the commit. That is what params_set does, and
//     value_written != value_read_back is a FAILURE, not a warning.
//   * type_name_after comes from fm.CurrentType.Name re-read after the commit,
//     never from the family_name we were handed. RenameCurrentType throwing into
//     an `except: pass` is exactly how the local variable and the model diverge.
//   * params_removed is counted by RE-READING fm.Parameters. RemoveParameter is
//     void too, and Revit refuses it for referenced parameters; the earlier
//     script's "borrados 12" is a count of calls that did not throw.
//   * params_added likewise: the AddParameter that silently did nothing is the
//     same lie, and it is the one that ships a family missing its parameter set.
//
// THE GEOMETRY INVARIANT â€” the reason this is a handler and not a script.
//
// The earlier script already knows the rule. Its own comments say "Verifica que
// el conteo de params Double NO cambie" and "IsCustom mueve geometria!". But it
// enforces it by printing "borrados 12, saltados 3, Double 41->40" and trusting
// a human to read the arrow. Nothing stops nd0 != nd1; the batch moves on to the
// next family, and the deformed one is saved. Here the invariant is structural:
// the Double count and IsCustom's presence are captured BEFORE, re-enumerated
// FRESH from the family document after the writes, and if either moved the
// transaction is ROLLED BACK and the family is reported untouched. A batch
// cannot continue past a family whose geometry moved, because there is no path
// through this code that commits one.
//
// And "unproven" is not "fine". If any parameter in either census could not be
// read, the invariant cannot be established, so we roll back too: an invariant
// that passes because we could not look is worse than no invariant at all â€” it
// is a guarantee the caller will believe.
//
// THIS HANDLER NEVER OPENS A FILE. It operates on the ACTIVE family document.
// Opening a 2025 .rfa from Revit 2026 upgrades it irreversibly and breaks the
// family catalog â€” that decision belongs to the caller and to
// horizun_document_session, not to a write verb. rfa_path here is a GUARD (it
// must match the active document's PathName) and expected_revit_version is a
// second one, both checked before anything is written.

        //
        // Two reasons it is gone, and the second matters even if the first did not:
        //
        // 1. The list is the method. The tool decides HOW to strip safely - match,
        //    veto, protect, remove inside one transaction, verify by re-reading, roll
        //    back if the census moved. WHAT counts as junk belongs to whoever owns the
        //    families, and shipping it here gives it away.
        //
        // 2. A default list that deletes parameters is a hidden policy. A caller who
        //    sets enabled=true and passes nothing is agreeing to 71 substring rules
        //    they never read, against a family they may not own. Requiring the list
