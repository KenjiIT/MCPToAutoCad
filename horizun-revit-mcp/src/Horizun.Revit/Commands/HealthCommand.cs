// "Is anyone home, and WHICH Revit is it?" — the first call any workflow makes.
//
// Its whole value is telling you what you are actually talking to, because the
// expensive mistake is not a dead bridge, it is a live one attached to the wrong
// Revit: two versions are often open at once, and a scan aimed at the wrong
// instance reports confident numbers about the wrong building.
//
// So the answer is never a bare "ok". It carries the year, the process, and the
// document actually active right now. No document open is reported as an explicit
// null with no_active_document=true — not as an empty title, which reads like a
// document with no name.
