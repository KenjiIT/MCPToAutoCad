// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_manage_cad_links - the typed way to get a DWG into a model.
//
// Until this existed, every step of the DWG->BIM chain was typed except the
// first one: the harnesses linked their fixture through horizun_execute_python,
// and said so. A chain with one untyped link is a chain whose first step has no
// rehearsal, no confirmation token, no post-commit re-read, and no refusal it
// can be trusted to make.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT AN OPERATION ON horizun_manage_links, decided from the API and
// not from taste - three reasons, each on its own sufficient:
//
//   1. THERE IS NO CAD UNLOAD. RevitLinkType has Unload and UnloadLocally;
//      CADLinkType declares exactly four methods in every year 2023-2027 -
//      Reload(), Reload(CADLinkOptions), LoadFrom(string),
//      LoadFrom(ExternalResourceReference). Putting 'unload' in one enum where
//      it works for .rvt and permanently refuses for .dwg is one word reading
//      two ways, which is the thing this bridge refuses on principle.
//
//   2. THE ARGUMENTS ARE DISJOINT, NOT NESTED. Creating a CAD link is
//      Document.Link(string, DWGImportOptions, View, out ElementId) - there is
//      no view-free overload - carrying nine option fields that mean nothing to
//      an RVT link, while attachment/overlay, worksets and relative-vs-absolute
//      path type mean nothing to a DWG.
//
//   3. THE VERIFICATION DIVERGES, and this bridge is built on verification. An
//      RVT link proves a reload by re-reading a STATUS that changes. CADLinkType
//      has no GetLinkedFileStatus, and a CAD reload reads the same before and
//      after - so a status-based 'verified' would be true by construction. The
//      only honest post-condition for a CAD link is the drawing's CONTENT: the
//      file's SHA-256 and the geometry fingerprint horizun_query_cad already
//      publishes. That engine is here, not there.
//
// The API limit is published rather than hidden: 'unload' is reported by name in
// every reply, with what to do instead.
