// horizun_model_scan — one native pass that replaces two IronPython audit engines
// (preentrega_audit.py, 412 lines; revit_audit.py, 510 lines).
//
// Those two engines are the most silently-broken code in the estate, and every
// defect below was measured on real models. This handler exists to make each one
// unrepresentable rather than merely fixed:
//
//   1. `views_default_named_count = len(default_named)` where default_named was
//      capped at CAP=60 DURING the loop. 300 off-standard views got reported as
//      60 — a number the reader has no way to distrust. Here the full list is
//      built first and only the RETURN is capped, so `total` is the model's count
//      and `truncated` says out loud that you are not seeing all of it.
//   2. `section()` wrote {"_error": ...} and the host indexed d["warnings"]
//      without .get(). A section that threw either exploded in the host or, worse,
//      rendered as "CAD importado: 0 → OK". Here a failed section carries NO
//      buckets at all: there is no empty list to mistake for a clean result, and
//      `complete` is false at the top level.
//   3. `except: area = 0` then `elif area == 0: unbounded += 1` — a room whose
//      Area could not be read was reported as an unbounded room. "I could not
//      look" was silently spelled "there is something wrong there". Both engines
//      do it. Here unreadable is its own bucket, always.
//   4. `ename()` returned "?" on failure and "?" then failed every naming check.
//      A read error was reported as a naming violation. Here names come back raw
//      with `name_unreadable` beside them, and NOTHING here judges a name: the
//      standard is regex, the host has stdlib, and this tool has no opinion.
//   5. s_views computed no_template and threw the list away, so the correction
//      step had no ids to act on. It is returned.
//   6. 'unused' was derived from FamilyInstance only — see TypesWithNoInstances.
//
// Read-only by construction: no transaction is opened, so a scan cannot damage
// the model it is judging.
