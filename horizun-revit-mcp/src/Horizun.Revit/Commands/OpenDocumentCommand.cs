// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// Open a model and make it active — with the guards that make this command safe to
// hand to an automation instead of a person.
//
// THE GUARDS THEMSELVES LIVE IN Core/OpenGuard.cs, shared with
// horizun_document_session's open. They used to be written out here and again
// there, months apart, and each copy ended up strict about something the other was
// not: this one had the central guard and no newer-file rule, that one had the
// newer-file rule and no central guard at all. Neither file shows that on its own.
// Read OpenGuard.cs for what they are and why; this file is now about what happens
// AFTER the guards say yes.
//
// And what happens after is: the active document is re-read and compared to what
// was asked, because "Revit did not throw" is not evidence that the document you
// now hold is the one you named.
//
// CLOUD MODELS (ACC / BIM 360) are opened by GUID instead of by path, and that
// changes what can be promised — so it says so rather than reporting the same
// fields and hoping:
//
//   * THE VERSION GUARD CANNOT RUN. BasicFileInfo reads a file on disk; a cloud
//     model has no path to read before it is open, so its saved version is
//     unknowable up front. The response reports version_guard="not_applicable_cloud"
//     and a null file_saved_in_version. That is not the same as "checked and fine",
//     and it is not spelled like it.
//
//   * A BREADCRUMB IS LEFT BEFORE THE OPEN. Opening a cloud model can take Revit
//     down with it — an access violation inside Revit's own loader, with nothing
//     on the managed side to catch. Measured on 2026-07-30 over 24 ACC models:
//     Revit 2025.4 died twice with 0xc0000005 in SelectedPartitionsForEdit /
//     decommitDocument, and the only record of WHICH model was in Revit's own
//     journal — the process that knew could no longer write. So the model being
//     attempted goes to the log BEFORE the call. A line with no result after it
//     names the model that did it.
//
//     The follow-up is why open_all_worksets defaults to false. Both crashes were
//     the same signature, both with 30 GB of RAM free, and BOTH MODELS OPENED AND
//     READ FINE once the all-worksets configuration was dropped. That makes it the
//     option, not the models — SelectedPartitionsForEdit is workset code. Reach for
//     it when something downstream measures worksets, and drop it first when a
//     specific model dies on open.
