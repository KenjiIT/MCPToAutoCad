// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_plan_cad_update - revision A is in the model, revision B is on screen.
//
// READ-ONLY. It emits actions somebody else executes, exactly like
// horizun_plan_from_cad, and for the same reason: the decision to overwrite what
// is already in a model is not one a planner should be able to take by itself.
//
// The actions it emits are ready calls to commands that already rehearse,
// confirm and re-read their own work: horizun_create_elements for what revision B
// adds, and horizun_transform_elements set_curve for a moved wall whose pairing a
// PERSON has accepted.
//
// That last clause is the whole design. Nothing in a DWG says the wall in
// revision B is the wall from revision A - there is no handle anywhere in the
// Revit CAD API, measured - so a line that moved arrives as a create and an
// orphan. The resemblance between them is OFFERED, with what it was judged on,
// and acted on only when the caller sends it back. What a person moved in the
// model is never in the action list at all.
