// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_plan_from_cad — a drawing, a requirement set, and a plan nobody has
// built yet.
//
// READ-ONLY, deliberately and completely. It opens no transaction and creates
// nothing; it measures the CAD, reads it through the caller's requirement set,
// and hands back an ordered plan plus everything needed to decide whether to
// run it. That separation is the point: the argument about what a drawing MEANS
// happens before, and separately from, the writing.
//
// WHAT COMES BACK, AND WHY EACH PART IS THERE:
//
//   actions_by_stage   the order a building goes up in. A door cannot be hosted
//                      by a wall that does not exist yet.
//   deferred_detail    every candidate nobody will build, with its reason, its
//                      rival readings and the facts the drawing did not carry.
//                      This is the half a reviewer actually reads.
//   coverage           how much of the drawn geometry the reading accounts for.
//                      A requirement set that quietly matches a tenth of a
//                      drawing produces a confident-looking plan of nearly
//                      nothing, and this is the number that shows it.
//   plan_fingerprint   what the plan is BOUND to: the drawing's bytes, the
//                      link's transform, the requirement set's hash, the
//                      resolved actions, and whether review was bypassed. The
//                      apply refuses if any of it moved.
//   execute_plan_request  the plan as a ready call, so applying it reuses the
//                      atomic, confirmed, verified write path this bridge
//                      already has rather than a second one written for CAD.
