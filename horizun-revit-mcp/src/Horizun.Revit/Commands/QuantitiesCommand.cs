// horizun_quantities — volume takeoff that refuses to pick a number for you.
//
// This is the tool whose output becomes money, so it is the one most worth being
// paranoid about.
//
// Revit reports an element's volume from three places, and they do not always
// agree. On a real beam in our own test model:
//
//     Volume parameter ......... 0.4531 m3
//     Actual solid geometry .... 0.7913 m3
//     Material takeoff ......... 0.7913 m3
//
// A 75% gap on the quantity you bill. Every handler we looked at reads exactly
// one of these — usually the parameter, because it is the cheap one — and
// reports it as "the volume", with no hint the other two exist or disagree. If
// you had billed that beam from the parameter you would have billed 57% of the
// concrete you poured.
//
// (Why they disagree is legitimate: the parameter is cached and can lag joins,
// openings and cuts; the geometry is what is actually there at this detail
// level; the material takeoff is what the material schedule will say. Which one
// is "right" depends on your measurement criteria — which is precisely why this
// handler will not choose. It reports all three and flags the gap.)
//
// So: all three sources, side by side, in m3, with the disagreement measured and
// named. The quantity surveyor decides. That is their job, and their signature.
