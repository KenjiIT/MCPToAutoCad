// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The shape every recipe-backed tool has, written once.
//
// These tools began as pyRevit buttons. A button is allowed to be casual about
// three things because a person is watching it: WHICH document it edits (the one
// on screen), WHETHER the user meant it (a dialog), and WHETHER it worked (you
// look). None of the three survives being called by an agent, so each becomes
// explicit here, and identically for every tool:
//
//   * target_document, through DocumentGate.ForMutation — a mutation names its
//     model, because "the active document" is whatever window was in front when
//     the call arrived;
//   * dry_run, defaulting to TRUE, and a single-use confirmation_token bound to
//     this document AND this plan before anything is written;
//   * a verification block per counted quantity, built by Guard.Verify from the
//     count the recipe claimed and the count the model reports after the commit.
//
// A subclass supplies four things: the tool name, the description the caller
// reads, the recipe that carries the geometry, and which counts must agree. It
// supplies no control flow, so no tool can quietly skip a step.
