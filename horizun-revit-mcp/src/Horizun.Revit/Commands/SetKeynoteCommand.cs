// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_set_keynote — replaces apply_keynote_to_element.
//
// Keynotes are how Horizun ties a model to a budget: the keynote code is the
// join key between an element and a line item. A keynote that silently did not
// land is a quantity that silently does not get billed, so this handler is built
// to be unable to claim a write it cannot prove.
//
// Three defects in the handler this replaces, all of which we hit for real:
//
//   1. THE BLAST RADIUS. In Revit the Keynote parameter lives on the TYPE, not
//      the instance — that is the normal case, not the edge case. The old
//      handler walked to the type, wrote there, and reported the ELEMENT id. So
//      "keynote applied to 1 door" quietly re-coded every door of that type in
//      the project. Nothing in the response hinted at it. We now resolve the
//      write target first, write each type ONCE, and report exactly which
//      elements were affected — including the ones the caller never mentioned.
//   2. `Parameter.Set()` returns a bool and the old code discarded it. Set() can
//      decline a write and return false without throwing. Reporting "updated"
//      off a call that returned false is the same class of lie as counting a
//      rolled-back Commit as success.
//   3. Nothing re-read the model afterwards. We now read the value back and
//      compare, so what we report is the model's state, not our intent.
//
// Also: ids that are not integers used to be dropped from the request without a
// word, and `requested` was counted after the drop, so the numbers looked
// consistent while the caller's elements were never touched. They are errors now.
