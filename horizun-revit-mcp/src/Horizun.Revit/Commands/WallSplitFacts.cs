// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// READING a compound wall: the half of the decomposition that needs a Revit.
//
// WallLayerRules decides where every layer goes, what carries the doors and what
// each resulting type is called - and it does all of that without a Document, so
// it can be argued with at a desk. This file is the other half: it READS the
// live wall, MEASURES the things whose answer no documentation can settle, and
// takes the census of everything hanging off the wall before a transaction is
// opened.
//
// Two readings here are measurements rather than conventions, deliberately:
//
//   * THE EXTERIOR DIRECTION. Wall.Orientation is a documented convention, it is
//     not constant along an arc, and the previous implementation combined it with
//     wall.Flipped so the two corrections could cancel. Here the exterior normal
//     is taken from the wall's own EXTERIOR SHELL FACE - a normal computed off
//     the solid Revit actually built. It already contains the flip, because the
//     flip is what decides which face that is.
//
//   * WHAT THE WALL CARRIES. FindInserts plus GetDependentElements, and every
//     entry classified in the closed vocabulary. The previous implementation
//     looked only at FamilyInstances whose Host was the wall, which is why
//     sweeps, reveals, embedded curtain walls and hosted rebar went out with the
//     deletion without appearing in any report.
//
// Nothing here writes. The command opens the transaction.
