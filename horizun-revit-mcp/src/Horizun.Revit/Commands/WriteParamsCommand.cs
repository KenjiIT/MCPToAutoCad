// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_write_params_verified — the WRITE verb, shared by all five processes.
//
// Every skill in the estate has hand-written this same loop:
//
//     try: p.Set(v); n += 1
//     except: pass
//     ...
//     __output__ = "Datos de proyecto actualizados"
//
// and every one of them lies in a different place. The four failures we have
// actually measured, each of which this handler is built to be unable to report
// as success:
//
//   1. `Parameter.Set()` RETURNS A BOOL. It declines writes without throwing —
//      a formula-driven Description, an incompatible ViewTemplateId, an element
//      borrowed by another user. Counting a Set() that returned false is the
//      same class of lie as counting a rolled-back Commit as success. We check
//      the bool, and we still do not trust it (see 3).
//   2. The parameter is null or IsReadOnly, `if p and not p.IsReadOnly` skips it
//      in silence, and the row is counted anyway. Here an unresolvable target or
//      parameter is a row with an error, never a row that vanishes: the counts
//      would otherwise reconcile perfectly while the caller's elements were
//      never touched.
//   3. The setter is accepted and Revit ignores it. So the only value we are
//      willing to call written is one we RE-READ from the document AFTER the
//      commit. value_written != value_read_back is a FAILURE, not a warning.
//   4. The transaction rolls back after the loop and the pre-computed counter is
//      returned anyway — the 758-purged incident, verbatim. We commit only
//      through Guard.Commit, the terminal transaction state is a
//      first-class field, and a rolled-back transaction forces changed:false on
//      every row no matter what the loop saw.
//
// Two more things this owes to the processes it serves:
//
//   * ONE transaction, one undo step (/codificar rule 5 — the requirement that
//     forces that skill into raw python today, because no bridge tool exposes a
//     transaction at all).
//   * A write to a TYPE re-codes every instance of that type. That is the normal
//     case for Keynote, not the edge case. The blast radius is reported from a
//     full census — deliberately NOT FamilyInstanceFilter, which returns EMPTY
//     without throwing for wall/floor/roof types, i.e. reports a radius of zero
//     for exactly the categories where a type-wide write does the most damage.
//
// And when a batch goes wrong the caller decides, not us: 'atomic' rolls the
// whole thing back (default — a half-coded model is worse than an uncoded one),
// 'best_effort' commits what worked. The mode that actually ran is reported.
