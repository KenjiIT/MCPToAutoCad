// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// MEASURED, NOT NOMINAL. And a real route, not a straight line.
//
// horizun_audit_access shipped saying two things about itself, both true and one
// of them a dead end that should never have been one:
//
//   "a door width is NOMINAL" — the type's parameter, not the gap somebody walks
//   through.
//   "a distance to an exit is a STRAIGHT LINE THAT CROSSES WALLS, never a travel
//   distance."
//
// The second was recorded as a limit of the API. IT IS NOT.
// Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis.PathOfTravel.FindShortestPaths exists in every Revit
// this bridge supports — 2023 through 2027 — and computes real routes around real
// obstacles, returning each path as a list of points. It creates no elements and
// opens no transaction. "The API has no property for it" was true and was never
// the same statement as "it cannot be obtained".
//
// WHAT THE ROUTE COSTS, said here rather than discovered:
//
//   IT NEEDS A FLOOR PLAN VIEW. The calculation is two-dimensional, per level, in
//   a specific plan. Which plan is a choice with consequences: obstacles are what
//   THAT view shows, so a plan with furniture hidden measures a building with no
//   furniture in it.
//   THE DESTINATIONS' Z IS IGNORED and replaced with the view's level elevation.
//   Destinations on another level are silently flattened onto this one.
//   AN EMPTY PATH MEANS NO ROUTE, which is a finding: a room with no way out is
//   the most important thing this measurement can say, and it arrives as an empty
//   array rather than as an error.
//   IT IS NOT AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. The service can be absent; that is reported
//   as a coverage gap, never as a passing check.
//   AND THE ARGUMENT ORDER IS (view, DESTINATIONS, STARTS). Backwards, against
//   every expectation, and silently plausible when swapped — which is why it is
//   wrapped here exactly once.
//
// THE WIDTH IS HONEST ABOUT BEING SOMETHING ELSE. Geometry gives the ROUGH
// OPENING in the wall: more than the type's nominal parameter, less than a clear
// width, which subtracts the leaf and the hardware and is defined at a door
// opened ninety degrees. Reporting it as "clear width" would trade a known
// approximation for an unknown one, so it is reported as what it is and the
// difference is stated in the same row.
//
// EVERY MEASUREMENT CARRIES ITS OWN UNCERTAINTY AND ITS OWN COVERAGE. A check
// that could not be measured says so instead of falling back to the nominal value
// and reading as measured.
