// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// MAY THIS ASYNCHRONOUS WORK BE ACCEPTED AT ALL? One answer, in one place.
//
// Both asynchronous entry points - horizun_submit_job and execute_python with
// run_async - open a job record and then queue the work. Both had their own
// version of "did that work?", and both versions were wrong in the same way:
// SubmitJobCommand tested `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(job.Id)` against an id that
// was assigned before anything could fail, and ExecutePythonCommand tested
// nothing at all. A record that could not be created was therefore queued, and
// the caller was handed a job_id addressing no file.
//
// The rule is small and the consequence of getting it wrong is not, so it lives
// here, Revit-free, and is proved in CI rather than reasoned about twice. The
// commands need a UIApplication and cannot be tested without a Revit; this can.
