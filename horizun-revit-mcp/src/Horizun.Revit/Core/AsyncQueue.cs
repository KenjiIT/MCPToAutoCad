// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// Work that outlives its request.
//
// A script that takes twenty minutes cannot be answered inside a request: the
// client times out, and then the honest question is what happened to the work.
// The previous answer was "it is still running inside Revit and its result will
// reach nobody" - true, and useless.
//
// AT-MOST-ONCE IS THE WHOLE POINT, because this queue carries MUTATIONS. Take()
// removes the entry under a lock and returns it once; a second raise of the
// external event finds nothing and does nothing. There is no retry, no requeue
// on failure, and no path that runs an entry twice - a re-run of a script that
// already wrote to a model is a second write, not a recovery.
//
// The queue is IN MEMORY on purpose. If Revit dies, the job's record on disk
// stops without a finish line, and horizun_job_status reports exactly that
// rather than guessing between "still running" and "the process died". A queue
// that survived the process would invite replaying a mutation whose outcome
// nobody knows.
