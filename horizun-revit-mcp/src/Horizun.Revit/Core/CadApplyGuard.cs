// Horizun Core - original Horizun code.
//
// WHAT A PLAN MUST STILL BE TRUE OF BEFORE ANYTHING IS WRITTEN.
//
// horizun_apply_cad_plan has re-measured its binding since it existed: the drawing,
// the rules, the actions, the document, the Revit build, the reading, and - since
// block 8 - the identity of the whole source SET and whether the link and the files
// can be shown to be the same issue.
//
// horizun_apply_cad_update had none of it. MEASURED by reading it: it checks that
// 'actions' is a list, that provenance is present, that a placement move is consented
// to again, and that the reading version matches. It never reads apply_binding at
// all - the plan emits one and nothing consumes it - so the actions could be edited,
// the drawing revised, the link reloaded or the requirement set swapped, and the
// update would delete fittings, re-shape runs and re-stamp provenance anyway.
//
// An update writes MORE dangerously than a first conversion: it deletes, it re-shapes
// elements somebody may have touched, and it rewrites the record that says where they
// came from. So the check lives here, once, and both commands call it. Two copies of
// a rule this important is how one of them quietly stops being true.
//
// The order matters and is deliberate:
//
//   1. DRIFT  - something moved between the plan and this apply. Named one by one,
//               because "stale" without a noun sends the reader to look everywhere.
//   2. COHERENCE - the prior question: can the geometry the plan was made of and the
//               files its sizes came from be shown to be the same issue at all? A
//               plan made while that could not be shown is not applied because the
//               model looks unchanged; it is not applied because nobody measured it.
//
// Both refuse with NOTHING WRITTEN, and both name what to do next.
