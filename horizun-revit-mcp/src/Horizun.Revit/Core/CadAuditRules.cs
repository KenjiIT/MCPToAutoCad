// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// What the drawing says, against what the model holds.
//
// The audit answers one question - "does this model still agree with this
// drawing?" - and it answers it WITHOUT writing anything, because the moment an
// audit can change the thing it is measuring, nobody can use its output as
// evidence.
//
// The matching is a LADDER, and which rung a pair matched on is part of the
// finding, because the rungs mean different things:
//
//   revision   the same entity, in the same issue of the same file. Nothing to do.
//   semantic   the same entity, same layer, same shape - in a DIFFERENT issue of
//              the drawing. The file was re-cut; the building did not change.
//   geometry   the same shape on a DIFFERENT layer. Somebody relayered it, and
//              that usually means it now means something else.
//   position   no provenance at all, but something is standing exactly where the
//              drawing says. Built by hand, or by a run older than provenance.
//
// A pair that matches on a lower rung is not a failure. It is a fact about what
// happened between the two, and reporting it as a match with no qualifier would
// hide the only interesting part.
