// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// WHERE A NESTED SYMBOL ACTUALLY IS.
//
// A block instance inside a block DEFINITION carries coordinates in that
// definition's own system, not the drawing's. Measured on a real permit set: the
// washing-machine symbol reports (0.0, 4.8) and the air-handler symbols report
// coordinates ten times outside the drawing's extents, because none of them is
// placed in model space - they are all drawn inside unit blocks, and the unit
// blocks are what gets placed.
//
// Converting those coordinates directly puts every symbol in the building near
// the origin, in a model that otherwise looks finished. So this composes the
// chain: for every placement of the parent block, the nested symbol appears once,
// transformed by that placement.
//
// THAT IS ALSO WHAT MAKES A REPEATED UNIT WORK. One unit block drawn once and
// placed eight times gives eight sets of symbols, each in its own apartment, each
// with its own identity - and the identity is what stops the second conversion
// building them all again.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES. A block that contains itself, directly or through a chain, is
// a cycle: it is reported and not expanded, because the expansion does not
// terminate and the drawing is wrong. A chain deeper than the declared limit is
// reported with its depth rather than silently truncated.
