// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// A SYMBOL IS A BLOCK, AND A BLOCK HAS THE NAME ITS AUTHOR TYPED.
//
// Everything else in this conversion reads line work and infers: two parallel
// lines might be a wall, a closed ring might be a slab, a cluster of marks might
// be a fixture. A block instance is different in kind - somebody drew a symbol,
// named it, and placed it. `OUT2`, `TEL-DATA`, `E-LTS-VANITY`, `PNL`: those are
// not inferences, they are statements, and they are the shortest path there is
// from a drawing to a family type.
//
// The requirement set could already say `from: "blocks"` and the interpreter had
// no branch for it - the rule parsed, matched nothing, and reported nothing. This
// is that branch.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It does not guess a family from a block name: the
// mapping is the caller's artefact, like every other mapping in this bridge. It
// does not resolve a tie between two rules of equal precedence - that is two
// readings of one symbol and a person decides. And it does not invent the things
// a plan symbol cannot carry: a height, a circuit, a load. Those are declared or
// they are missing, and missing is said out loud.
//
// XREF-QUALIFIED NAMES. A block that arrives through an external reference is
// called "DRAWING|NAME" - measured on a real permit set, where every symbol in
// the unit plan came through as "UNIT-XREF|VANITY-LIGHT". A pattern matches
// against both the qualified name and the bare one, because a caller writing a
// mapping should not have to know which drawing a symbol was nested in.
