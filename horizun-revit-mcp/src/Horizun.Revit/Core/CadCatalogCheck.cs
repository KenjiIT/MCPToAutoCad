// A PROJECT'S DATA, CHECKED AS ONE SET BEFORE ANY OF IT IS USED.
//
// A conversion reads a requirement set rule by rule, and refuses at the first
// name the model does not know. That is right for a write and useless for the
// person assembling the data: they learn one missing family per run. This checks
// every rule against the model at once - the type exists, its family can be
// placed the way the rule says it is hosted, the storey exists, a height is or
// is not declared, the category agrees - and says which rules would be built,
// which would be refused, and why. It reads no drawing and writes nothing.
