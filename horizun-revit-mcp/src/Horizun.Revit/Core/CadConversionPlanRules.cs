// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The plan: candidates become an ORDERED set of typed create_elements actions,
// or they become a reason nobody built them.
//
// This file does the one thing that turns an interpretation into something a
// model can be built from, and it does it WITHOUT touching Revit, so the whole
// argument - what gets built, in what order, and what is deliberately left out -
// is inspectable and testable before any transaction opens.
//
// THREE THINGS IT REFUSES TO PAPER OVER:
//
//   ORDER IS A DEPENDENCY, NOT A PREFERENCE. A door cannot be hosted by a wall
//   that does not exist yet. The plan emits stages, each stage naming what it
//   needs from the one before, so a partial run leaves a model that is missing
//   things rather than a model with things in the wrong place.
//
//   NOTHING INELIGIBLE IS PLANNED. A candidate a reviewer has to look at is
//   listed as deferred, with the reason carried through verbatim. An unattended
//   run therefore builds only what nobody has to argue about, which is the
//   difference between a tool you can leave running and one you must watch.
//
//   THE PLAN NAMES ITS OWN BINDING. Everything that could make the same request
//   mean something different later - the drawing's bytes, the link's transform,
//   the requirement set's hash, the resolved candidate set - is folded into one
//   fingerprint. If any of it moved, the apply is refused rather than aimed at a
//   model that has changed underneath it.
//
// Revit-free.
