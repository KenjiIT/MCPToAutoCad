// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// READING A DRAWING COSTS SIX MINUTES. INTERPRETING IT COSTS NOTHING.
//
// MEASURED on a real electrical permit drawing: 343.8 s of headless AutoCAD per
// read, and one campaign session spent six of them on the SAME file, because
// changing a rule or a zone meant running the whole route again. The rules and
// the zone are the things a person iterates on; the file is the thing that does
// not move.
//
// So the two halves are separated. Extraction produces the reader's raw report
// and that is what is cached. Interpretation parses it and applies the rules,
// every time, from scratch - so a changed rule, a changed zone, a changed
// tolerance is always honoured and never served from a cache.
//
// WHAT THE KEY IS MADE OF, and why each part is in it:
//
//   the drawing's SHA-256        a new issue of the file is a different drawing
//   every external reference     an xref is part of what was read; a changed
//                                one changes the reading with the host file
//                                untouched
//   the engine's version         a different AutoCAD reads differently
//   the extractor's own text     the .lsp is the reader; editing it invalidates
//                                every reading made by the old one
//   the extraction options       what was asked for, not what was done with it
//
// A cache that cannot say why it hit is a cache nobody should trust, so every
// hit reports the key it matched and the parts that made it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT IN THE KEY, deliberately: the requirement set, the zone, the
// tolerances, the level, the target document. None of them change what the
// reader saw, and putting them in would defeat the whole point.
