// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.

// The geometry walk: what Revit hands over for a DWG, turned into segments the
// Revit-free rules can reason about.
//
// MEASURED against a real linked DWG on Revit 2026, and the shape of this file
// follows what actually came back rather than what the API suggests is possible:
//
//   - one top-level GeometryInstance, everything else inside it;
//   - Line, PolyLine, Arc and Solid at depth 1;
//   - the layer on the LEAF, never on the instance;
//   - Solids with zero volume and no layer - the residue of hatches, reported
//     as `approximate` and never counted as geometry anyone can build from;
//   - not one reachable string, on any object, at any depth.
//
// Everything is converted to MILLIMETRES here, once, so that no rule downstream
// has to know that Revit thinks in decimal feet.
