// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The Revit-FREE geometry a DWG reading is made of.
//
// Everything a CAD drawing means to a model has to survive three hostile facts,
// and they are the reason this file exists apart from Revit:
//
//   1. A DWG DOES NOT SAY WHAT IT IS. It says "two parallel lines 200 mm apart".
//      Whether that is a wall is an interpretation, and an interpretation has to
//      be arguable - which means the geometry it argues from must be inspectable
//      without a Revit in the room.
//
//   2. NOTHING IN THE DWG HAS A STABLE NAME. Measured on Revit 2026 against a
//      real linked DWG: GeometryObject.Id COLLIDES - 35 objects came back with
//      24 distinct ids, and nine PolyLines all answered Id = 1. There is no
//      AutoCAD handle anywhere in the Revit API (an exhaustive member search
//      over RevitAPI.dll found none). So identity is a SURROGATE we compute, and
//      the algorithm that computes it has to be pinned by tests, because every
//      incremental update and every audit match depends on it being the same
//      number tomorrow.
//
//   3. COORDINATES ARE NOT MILLIMETRES. They are whatever the drawing was set
//      up in, transformed by however it was linked. Unit normalisation is the
//      first thing that happens and the last thing anyone should have to think
//      about afterwards.
//
// Nothing here reads a model, opens a document or touches the Revit API. Feed it
// numbers, get numbers back, and pin them with tests.
