// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// Interpretation: geometry plus a requirement set becomes CANDIDATES.
//
// Nothing here builds anything. It produces proposals, each carrying the
// evidence for itself, and the single most important thing it produces is the
// list of proposals it REFUSES to make on its own.
//
// WHAT CONFIDENCE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.
//
// Confidence here is a weighted score over NAMED, MEASURED factors - overlap
// fraction, angular deviation, how specific the matching layer pattern was, how
// many rules competed for the same geometry. It is not a probability. Nothing
// calibrated it against outcomes, and no number it produces means "84% of these
// are correct". It exists for one purpose: to ORDER candidates and to sit
// against a threshold the requirement set declared, so that a reviewer looks at
// the weakest ones first. Every score ships with the factors that produced it,
// so a reviewer can disagree with the weighting instead of with the number.
//
// AMBIGUITY IS AN OUTPUT, NOT AN ERROR. Two rules claiming one piece of
// geometry, a loop that could be a room or a slab, a line pair that could be a
// wall or a stair - these are the normal content of a real drawing. An
// unattended run models NONE of them and says so; that is the difference
// between a tool somebody can leave running and a tool somebody has to watch.
//
// Revit-free.
