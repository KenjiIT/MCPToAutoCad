// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// THE INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION: what a DWG said, apart from who read it.
//
// Until this file existed, "what the drawing contains" and "what Revit's
// imported-geometry walk can reach" were the same object. That is a defensible
// engineering choice right up to the moment somebody asks whether a better
// reader would help — and then it is unanswerable, because the loss is not
// recorded anywhere. A layer with no text looks exactly like a layer whose text
// the reader could not reach, and every rule downstream matches nothing and
// reports a clean zero.
//
// So the reading is split in two:
//
//   THE IR        what was found: layers, entities, blocks, external
//                 references, units, extents. Reader-agnostic, versioned,
//                 serialisable, and comparable between two issues of a file.
//
//   THE READER    what the thing that produced it COULD have found. Declared
//   CAPABILITY    per axis, measured or stated, and carried WITH the IR
//                 forever after.
//
// The second half is the point. A rule that needs entity text asks the IR, and
// gets one of three answers: here it is; this drawing has none; THIS READER
// CANNOT SUPPLY TEXT AND THAT IS WHY YOU SEE NONE. The third answer is the one
// that was previously impossible to give, and it is the difference between "the
// drawing has no room names" and "ask for a reader that can see them".
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not read a DWG. It does not
// name a reader, a library, or a vendor. It is the shape both sides agree on:
// an adapter over Revit's geometry walk fills it in with most axes declared
// unavailable, and any future adapter — one that parses the file itself — fills
// in more, without one line of the interpretation rules changing. The rules
// consume the IR and the capability, never a reader.
//
// Revit-free, on purpose: this is the contract, and a contract that needs a
// running Revit to inspect is not one anybody can argue with at a desk.
