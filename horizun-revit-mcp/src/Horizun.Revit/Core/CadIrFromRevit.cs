// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// THE FIRST READER: Revit's own imported-geometry walk, adapted to the IR.
//
// This is one adapter, not the reading model. It fills <see cref="CadIr"/> with
// what a DWG that has been imported or linked into Revit will actually give
// back, and — the part that matters — it DECLARES, axis by axis, what it could
// not give and why. Nothing downstream asks "can Revit see text?"; it asks the
// IR whether the text axis is usable, and this file is what makes that question
// answerable instead of guessable.
//
// WHAT THIS READER IS GOOD AT. Geometry and layer names. Revit resolves the
// drawing's units at import time and hands geometry back in its own decimal
// feet, so the millimetres here are correct whenever the import scale was — and
// they are correct without anybody parsing the DWG header.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO, and the difference between the two reasons:
//
//   TEXT       measured on Revit 2026: no string is reachable from imported DWG
//              geometry at any depth. Text arrives as curves on its own layer.
//              The layer name survives; the words do not.
//
//   HANDLES    the walk yields GeometryObject, which has no route back to the
//              DWG entity that produced it. Two revisions of one drawing can
//              therefore only be compared by GEOMETRY, never by identity.
//
//   BLOCKS     a nested GeometryInstance proves a block was placed and gives
//              its nesting depth. It does not give the definition's NAME, so a
//              symbol cannot be recognised by name - only re-derived from the
//              arcs it is drawn with.
//
//   XREFS      the drawing's own external references are resolved by Revit at
//              import and flattened into one instance. What files the drawing
//              referenced is not recoverable from the geometry.
//
// Every one of those is a fact about THIS READER. None of them is a fact about
// DWG files, and none should ever be copied into a sentence that begins "DWG
// does not support".
//
// LAYERS ARE READ TWICE, ON PURPOSE. Once from the geometry, which gives the
// layers something was actually harvested from, and once from the import's own
// subcategories, which gives every layer the drawing DECLARES. A layer in the
// second list and not the first is the single most useful thing this adapter
// produces: it is a layer whose content this reading lost.
