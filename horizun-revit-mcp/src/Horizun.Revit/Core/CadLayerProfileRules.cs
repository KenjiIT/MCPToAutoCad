// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHAT IS ON THIS LAYER, AND WHAT WOULD READ IT.
//
// Writing the first requirement set for an unfamiliar drawing is guesswork done
// blind: you pick a layer, guess a geometry source, guess a thickness band, run
// the conversion, and find out. Every wrong guess costs a round trip through a
// model.
//
// This answers the measurable half of that question and REFUSES the other half.
//
// WHAT IT ANSWERS: for each layer, what each geometry source would actually find
// there, measured by running THE SAME READER the conversion runs. Not a
// heuristic that resembles it - the reader itself, so a count here is a count
// there. And the ranges it observed: the thicknesses the double lines actually
// sit at, the areas the rings actually enclose.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES: to say what a layer MEANS. Nothing here maps A-WALL to walls,
// and nothing ever should - a bridge that shipped one organisation's layer
// convention would quietly convert the next organisation's drawing wrong, and
// the model would look entirely plausible. The drawing says where the geometry
// is; it does not say what the building is, and a person supplies that.
//
// So the output is measurements and a SKELETON with every `produces` left empty.
// Filling those in is the decision this file exists to inform and not to make.
// It lives in Core and carries no `using Autodesk.*`, for the same reason every
// other decision here does: what a reader would find on a layer is arithmetic
// over geometry, and it should be arguable at a desk rather than only against a
// model somebody has to build first.
