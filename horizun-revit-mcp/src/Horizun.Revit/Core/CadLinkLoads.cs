// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// WHICH ISSUE OF THE DRAWING A LINK IS SHOWING.
//
// Revit records no moment for a CAD link's load. GetExternalFileReference gives a
// path; CADLinkType publishes no status that changes across a reload (which is why
// horizun_manage_cad_links verifies a reload by the geometry it hands back rather
// than by a status). So from inside the model there is no way to ask "is what I am
// looking at the file as it is now?", and on a sheet whose ductwork all lives in an
// xref the host's own hash cannot answer it either: the host's bytes do not move
// when its reference is revised.
//
// MEASURED (campaign 8, block 8): an xref edited with the host untouched. A reading
// with require_current_sources re-read the texts, re-hashed the host, reported
// sources_checked true - and returned the previous issue's geometry, because the
// link still held it. The plan made at that moment had the older runs and the newer
// labels, and the only thing the reply could say was that a label named nothing it
// could see.
//
// So when THIS BRIDGE loads a link - add, reload or repoint - it records what the
// link was loaded from: the file's hash, the identity of the whole source SET (host
// plus every reference resolved from beside it) and a fingerprint of the geometry
// Revit handed back. The last one is what keeps the record honest: if the link's
// geometry no longer fingerprints as it did, somebody reloaded or edited it outside
// this bridge and the record no longer describes what is loaded - which is reported
// as UNKNOWN, never as a disagreement this bridge cannot prove.
//
// The record lives beside the bridge's other state, on this machine. It does not
// travel with the model: on another machine, or after a save-as, there is no record
// and the answer is unknown. Unknown is the safe direction - it withholds "ready to
// apply" rather than granting it - and it is cleared by one typed reload.
