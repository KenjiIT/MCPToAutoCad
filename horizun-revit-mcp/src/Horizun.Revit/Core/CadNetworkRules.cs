// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// FROM LINES TO A NETWORK: the part that makes MEP from a DWG worth doing.
//
// A pipe created from A to B and another created from B to C are two pipes that
// happen to touch. Revit does not think they are connected, no system flows
// through them, nothing sizes, nothing schedules, and a coordination model built
// that way is a 3D picture of a 2D drawing. The difference between that and a
// model is entirely in this file: WHICH ends meet, WHAT fitting belongs there,
// and — the half that is usually skipped — WHICH apparent meetings are not
// meetings at all.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT REFUSES TO GUESS.
//
//   A CROSSING IS NOT A CONNECTION. Two lines crossing in a plan with no shared
//   endpoint are, almost always, two services at different elevations. Joining
//   them produces a tee nobody drew, in a model that then routes waste through a
//   water main. Every crossing is reported, and NONE is connected.
//
//   A GAP IS EITHER CLOSED OR IT IS A QUESTION. Ends inside the connect
//   tolerance are one node - that is what the tolerance is for, and the caller
//   declared it. Ends beyond it are an unresolved gap with the distance
//   measured, never quietly bridged, because the distance between "sloppy
//   drafting" and "these are deliberately separate systems" is a judgement about
//   the building.
//
//   ELEVATION IS NOT ZERO, IT IS UNKNOWN. A plan is drawn flat. Two runs meeting
//   at a node in plan are at the same place only if something said so. When the
//   caller declares elevations and they differ, this is a RISER or a mistake,
//   and either way it is not an elbow.
//
//   A JUNCTION REVIT CANNOT BUILD IS NOT ROUNDED DOWN. Five runs at one point is
//   not a cross with one ignored. It is refused, named, and left for a person.
//
// WHAT COMES OUT is a network of straight RUNS - one per MEP curve Revit will
// create - the JUNCTIONS between them, and the CONNECTION INTENTS that say which
// connector meets which and through what fitting. Nothing here touches Revit;
// the intents are carried out by the typed commands, which rehearse and re-read.
//
// Revit-free.
