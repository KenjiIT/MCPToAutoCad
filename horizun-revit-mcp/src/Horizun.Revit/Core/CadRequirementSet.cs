// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The document that says what a DWG MEANS, and the refusals that keep it honest.
//
// This bridge compiles no organisation's standard into itself. A layer called
// A-WALL-EXTR means an exterior wall in one office and nothing at all in the
// next, so the mapping arrives as a VERSIONED ARTEFACT the caller supplies, is
// validated whole, and stamps its identity onto everything produced from it.
// Three consequences, all deliberate:
//
//   A MALFORMED SET IS REFUSED ENTIRELY. Not "the valid rules ran". A document
//   with a typo in one rule is a document whose author believed something this
//   file cannot confirm, and applying the other nine rules to a model produces
//   a result nobody asked for that looks exactly like one somebody did.
//
//   EVERY RULE DECLARES ITS THRESHOLDS. Wall thickness bounds, overlap
//   fractions, gap tolerances, minimum confidence - none of them have a value
//   chosen in this file, because a number chosen here is a number nobody can
//   argue with in a review.
//
//   THE SET IS HASHED. Anything produced from a requirement set carries the
//   set's id, version and SHA-256, so a model can be asked which rules built it
//   and an incremental run can tell "the drawing changed" from "the rules did".
//
// Revit-free: JSON in, validated structure out, exceptions with reasons.
