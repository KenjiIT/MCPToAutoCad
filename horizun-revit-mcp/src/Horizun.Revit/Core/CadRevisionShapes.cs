// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.

// WHAT A DIVISION COSTS, SAID IN ONE PLACE.
//
// A split and a merge are spread across the plan: an orphan here, two creates
// there, evidence keys naming each other. Everything needed to judge one is in
// that plan and nothing assembles it, so the reader has to reconstruct - for each
// change - which element survives, which ids appear and disappear, what is joined
// to the ends that move, and what they are being asked to decide.
//
// This assembles it. One row per division, naming:
//
//   origin          the element, the drawing entity it was built from, the issue
//                   of the drawing it was built under, and the line it was built to
//   pieces          each piece with its geometry, and WHICH one keeps the element
//   keeps/creates/  the element ids that survive, the pieces that become new
//   removes         elements, and what a decision would remove
//   id_substitutions   empty when an id survives. An operation that must replace an
//                   element says so here rather than promising an id it cannot keep
//   fittings        every fitting joined to the ends that move, by element and type
//   connections     the connectors that must survive the operation
//   decisions       what is being asked, and what answering it does
//   geometry        the line before, and the lines after
//
// It reports; it decides nothing. A row appears for a division the plan HOLDS and
// for one a caller has accepted, and says which it is.
