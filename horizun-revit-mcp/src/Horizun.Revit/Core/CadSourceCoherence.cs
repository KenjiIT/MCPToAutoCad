// IS IT SAFE TO BUILD FROM THIS READING?
//
// A DWG-to-BIM plan is made of two halves that come from two places. The GEOMETRY
// is the CAD link, as Revit loaded it. The SIZES, systems and elevations come from
// the drawing FILE, read now through its own extractor. Those two can belong to
// different issues of the same drawing, and nothing in Revit says so: a link holds
// whatever it held when it was loaded, and the host file's hash does not move when
// one of its references is revised.
//
// MEASURED (campaign 8): an xref revised with the host untouched produced a plan of
// twenty-six runs from the previous issue and a label from the new one - and the
// only thing the reply could say was that the label named nothing it could see.
// Publishing two hashes made that observable. It did not make it SAFE: a caller
// reading a plan still had no answer to "may I apply this?".
//
// So this answers exactly that, in one of four states, and never guesses:
//
//   sources_match_the_link   this bridge loaded the link, nothing has touched it
//                            since (its geometry still fingerprints as recorded),
//                            and the source set hashes as it did then. APPLICABLE.
//
//   revisions_not_aligned    same, except the source set has changed since. The
//                            geometry is the older issue. NOT applicable: reload
//                            the link and plan again.
//
//   coherence_unknown        no record of this bridge loading it, or the link's
//                            geometry no longer matches the record - somebody
//                            loaded or edited it elsewhere - or the set identity
//                            could not be computed. NOT applicable, and it says
//                            which of those it is. Unknown is not a failure; it is
//                            the refusal to claim a correspondence nobody measured.
//
//   continued_snapshot       the reading continued a snapshot and deliberately
//                            checked nothing. NOT applicable by construction.
//
// The rule is one-directional on purpose: only a state this bridge can DEMONSTRATE
// grants "ready to apply". Everything else keeps the diagnosis and withholds the
// permission, and one typed reload clears it.
