// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// Topology: turning a heap of segments into the shapes a building is made of.
//
// This is where a DWG stops being lines and starts being arguable. Every routine
// here answers a question a draughtsman answers by looking, and every one of
// them can be wrong - so each returns the EVIDENCE for its answer alongside it,
// and none of them decides anything a caller did not ask for.
//
// The four questions:
//
//   WHERE DOES THIS LINE END?   Gaps are the normal state of a real drawing.
//                               Nodes are quantized so near-coincident endpoints
//                               become one node, and the snap distance is the
//                               caller's declared tolerance, never a default
//                               chosen here.
//
//   IS THIS A CLOSED SHAPE?     A room, a slab and a shaft are all "a loop", and
//                               a loop that is one 3 mm gap away from closing is
//                               the single most common thing in a CAD plan.
//
//   IS THIS A WALL?             Two parallel lines, overlapping along their own
//                               direction, a plausible thickness apart. The
//                               centreline between them is what a model wants,
//                               and the thickness is measured rather than typed.
//
//   IS THIS THE SAME AS BEFORE? Two issues of the same drawing must be comparable
//                               without a handle, which is what makes an
//                               incremental update possible at all.
//
// Revit-free. Feed it CadSegments, get shapes and evidence back.
