// AN UPDATE THAT CAN BE CONTINUED, AND SAY WHAT IT IS CONTINUING.
//
// Three things get called "retry" and they are not the same:
//
//   REPEAT        the same work, already finished. The answer is the reply that
//                 run produced, and nothing runs again.
//   CONTINUE      the same work, half done. The answer is to carry out what is
//                 still pending - and only that - under the decisions that were
//                 authorised for it, against the same world they were authorised
//                 against.
//   A NEW PLAN    the world moved. The old decisions do not carry: they were
//                 answers to a question that has changed.
//
// The in-session ledger covered the first and remembered the third existed. This
// covers the second, and it is durable on purpose: "save, close, open a new
// session and continue" is the case a caller actually has, and a record that lives
// in one Revit process cannot serve it.
//
// What a record holds, and why each part:
//
//   binding      the world the decisions were authorised against. A continuation
//                re-measures it through the same guard as a first apply: if
//                anything moved, the continuation is refused, because a decision
//                is an answer to a question and the question has changed.
//   decisions    what the caller authorised, and over which elements. A
//                continuation never invents them, and never widens them.
//   actions      one row each: confirmed, pending or failed, with the elements it
//                created or removed. That is what makes "carry out the rest"
//                mean something precise rather than "run it again and hope".
//
// The record is on this machine, beside the bridge's other state. It does not
// travel with the model - a continuation on another machine has no record and is
// told so, which is the safe direction.
