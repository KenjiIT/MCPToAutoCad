// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// Revision A is in the model. Revision B is on the screen. What now?
//
// This is the part of a DWG-to-BIM tool that earns its keep, and it is the part
// where a wrong answer is most expensive: a first conversion that goes wrong is
// noticed, because nothing was there before. An incremental update goes wrong
// quietly, on top of a week of somebody's work.
//
// So the rules here are built around one distinction the naive version cannot
// make. When the element in the model does not match the new drawing, there are
// TWO possible reasons and they need opposite treatment:
//
//   the DRAWING moved   - update the element, that is the whole point
//   a PERSON moved it   - updating would silently destroy their work
//   BOTH moved          - nobody but they can say which is right
//
// Telling them apart needs the geometry the element was BUILT with, which is why
// provenance records it. Without that record the honest answer is "something
// changed and I cannot say what", and this file says exactly that rather than
// guessing - a guess here is somebody's afternoon.
