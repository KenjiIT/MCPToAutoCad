// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// THE ONE PLACE A COMPOSITE TOOL TURNS ITS CHILDREN'S OWN VERDICTS INTO ITS OWN
// application BLOCK.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX, found in the 2026-09-24 inventory. A composite
// tool (horizun_apply_cad_plan, horizun_apply_cad_update, horizun_cad_connect,
// horizun_apply_ifc_plan, horizun_execute_plan) calls a typed child and then asks
// only "did the call answer Success?" - which is transport, not application (see
// ApplicationOutcome.cs). A child that answered Success over a rollback, a
// partial write, or an unmeasured result was counted as LANDED, exactly the
// failure ApplicationOutcome exists to end one level down, reproduced one level
// up because nothing forced a composite to look.
//
// THE RULE, reusing ApplicationOutcome.Applied's arithmetic rather than
// reinventing it (see that file's own note on why: "this cannot drift into a
// second opinion"). Each child is one unit:
//
//   * the child's transport failed (Success == false)              -> failed
//   * the child declared ApplicationState.NoOp                     -> excluded
//     (legitimately nothing was requested of it; it does not inflate the
//     denominator, and it does not count against the composite either)
//   * the child declared the state this call expects from a landed
//     child (VerifiedApplied on an apply, Rehearsed on a dry run)   -> counted
//     as both requested and fully landed
//   * the child declared ApplicationState.Uncertain, OR declared nothing
//     at all (ApplicationOutcome.Read is fail-closed on both)       -> unknown
//   * anything else the child declared (Partial, RolledBack, Failed,
//     or a Rehearsed state showing up where an apply was expected)  -> failed
//
// PURE AND REVIT-FREE ON PURPOSE, same reasoning as PlanLedger and
// CorrectionApplyLoop: every scenario that matters here - a child that rolled
// back, a child that said nothing, a mix of nine verified rows and one partial
// one - is exactly the shape a live Revit will not produce on demand, and the
// arithmetic has to be provably honest without one.
