// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// "Yes, do it" - tied to a specific document and a specific plan.
//
// A destructive command that takes a boolean confirm=true is not confirmed. The
// caller agreed to SOMETHING; nothing in the request says what. Between the
// dry-run that produced the plan and the call that executes it, any of these can
// change without anybody noticing:
//
//   * the active document (a second Revit, a user clicking another window);
//   * the model itself (a synchronize pulls in somebody else's work);
//   * the scope (the same category now matches 400 elements instead of 12).
//
// So the plan is what gets confirmed, not the intention. A dry run issues a token
// bound to THREE things - the command, a fingerprint of the document, and a hash
// of the plan - and execution is refused unless all three still match. The token
// is single-use and expires, because an approval from twenty minutes ago is an
// approval of a model that no longer exists.
//
// Refusals name which of the three broke. "Invalid token" tells the caller
// nothing they can act on; "the document changed" tells them exactly what to
// re-run.
//
// Revit-free: the rule has to be provable without a building, and the store is
// just a dictionary with a clock.
