// THE EXPLICIT LIST OF CORRECTIONS THIS BRIDGE WILL PROPOSE, AND NOW RUN.
//
// This file is the safety model of the whole correction surface, and it is a
// list on purpose. A proposal may name a tool ONLY if that tool appears here,
// with its arguments assembled from typed fields and typed constants declared
// here - because the alternative is composing a tool name and an argument
// object out of a finding's message, and that is how a report becomes an
// arbitrary command. Validation downstream cannot repair it: by the time a
// well-formed call exists, nothing is left to notice that nobody chose it.
//
// EVERY FINDING TYPE THE AUDIT EMITS HAS AN ENTRY, AND MOST OF THEM SAY NO.
// That ratio is the honest one. Most audit findings are not mechanically
// correctable: they are a modelling decision, a missing input, or somebody
// else's file. An entry that refuses and SAYS WHY is worth more than one that
// guesses, because the reader can act on the reason - and an entry that is
// simply absent reads like an oversight rather than a decision.
//
// FIVE ENTRIES ACT, through typed commands that already exist and already
// verify their own work after the commit:
//
//   unpinned_links          -> horizun_manage_links   pin, one per link
//   links (unloaded)        -> horizun_manage_links   reload, one per type
//   views_without_template  -> horizun_manage_views   apply_template, template
//                              supplied by the caller as an input
//   orphan_group_types      -> horizun_delete_verified ids, DESTRUCTIVE
//   rooms (unplaced only)   -> horizun_delete_verified ids, DESTRUCTIVE
//
// The two deletions are offers a person selects finding by finding, rehearses,
// and confirms with a token. Nothing here deletes because an audit said so.
//
// horizun_execute_python is not here and will not be. A correction surface with
// an arbitrary-code escape hatch has no safety model at all - it has a list of
// suggestions and a way around the list.
//
// Revit-free, so all of it is provable at a desk.
