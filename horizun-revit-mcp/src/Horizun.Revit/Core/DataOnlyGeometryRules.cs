// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// SpatialAfterWrite.cs skips the spatial coherence check for "data-only" tools
// (horizun_write_params_verified, horizun_family_apply, ...) because Revit's
// DocumentChanged cannot tell a moved element from a renamed one - a parameter
// write to ten thousand elements would otherwise pay a full spatial pass for
// every rename. But a parameter write CAN move geometry: an offset, a base
// height, a type swap that changes a family's footprint. Skipping outright
// misses exactly the write most likely to introduce the field defect this
// check exists for (a column and a door left in the same place).
//
// The dispatcher cannot snapshot "before" for ids it does not know about until
// the command has already run - so this is reactive: BBoxCache.cs (Revit-
// touching) remembers the last bounding box Attach saw for an element, across
// calls, and this file (pure, no Revit types) decides what that comparison
// means:
//
//   * a modified element WITH a remembered previous box: compare boxes. Moved
//     beyond the tolerance -> always checked. This is the precise half - no
//     false positives from an element that only had a parameter renamed.
//   * a modified element with NO remembered box (first time this process has
//     seen it, e.g. right after Revit started): unknown. Included WHOLE, never
//     partially, only when there are at most UnknownFallbackCap of them across
//     the call - the cheapest honest design: bounded cost, and the scope note
//     says exactly how many elements were, or were not, looked at and why.
//
// This is a documented LIMIT, not a guarantee: a data-only write to more than
// UnknownFallbackCap never-before-seen elements is not spatially checked at
// all. horizun_verify_changes (scope=last_write or session) remains the way to
// look at those elements after the fact once they are in the ledger.
