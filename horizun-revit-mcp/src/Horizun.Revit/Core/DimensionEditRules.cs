// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// THE RULES OF EDITING A DIMENSION, without a Revit in the room.
//
// A dimension is two different objects wearing one class. A single-segment
// dimension carries its overrides (prefix, suffix, value override, lock) on the
// element itself; a multi-segment dimension carries them on each DimensionSegment
// and throws when the element-level properties are touched. The EQ toggle exists
// only when there are segments to equalise. Get the split wrong and the failure
// is not a crash: Revit accepts some of the writes, ignores or throws on others,
// and a batch reports work it half did.
//
// So the split is a TABLE, here, where every row can be proved - which fields
// demand a single segment, which demand several, which do not care - and both
// the query and the edit command read the same table. The same file owns the
// other decisions that are arithmetic rather than API: how a shape name is
// classified for the wire, how a segment index is judged against the count, what
// "value_override: ''" means (REMOVE the override - Revit stores no override as
// an empty string, so writing one back is the deletion), the canonical 0.1 mm
// rounding used for before-values (Revit's own regeneration jitters the last
// digits of a coordinate, and a fingerprint that changes on its own would refuse
// every apply), the exact-move comparison with its declared tolerance, and the
// terminal-state matrix that turns a TransactionStatus plus a verification
// verdict into the one word a caller may branch on.
//
// Revit-free on purpose: no `using Autodesk`. The facts need Revit; these
// decisions do not, and the states that matter most - a rollback that returned
// Pending, a commit whose re-read disagrees - are exactly the ones a live Revit
// will not produce on demand.
