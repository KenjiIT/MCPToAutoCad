// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The UI-thread bridge and command registry.
//
// The Revit API may only be touched on Revit's own UI thread. Our transport runs
// on a background thread (a named pipe). This class is the crossing: a background
// caller hands us a command name + params, we raise a Revit ExternalEvent, Revit
// calls us back on the UI thread where we run the command, and we hand the result
// back to the blocked caller. ExternalEvent is the documented, supported way to
// do exactly this (Autodesk's own async-API guidance).
//
// One request EXECUTES at a time; later callers wait in a bounded FIFO queue.
// RequestGate owns the queue, per-request completion signals and cancellation
// before start. Once work reaches the UI thread it is not interruptible, so the
// distinction between queued and running is a safety boundary, not presentation.
