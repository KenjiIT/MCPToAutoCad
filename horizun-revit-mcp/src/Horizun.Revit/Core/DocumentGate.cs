// The check every mutating command makes before it touches anything.
//
// "The active document" is not an address. It is whatever window happened to be
// in front when the call arrived, and on a real machine that is decided by a
// second Revit instance, a user clicking, or a file finishing its open. A write
// aimed at "the active document" is a write aimed at whatever turns up.
//
// So a mutation must NAME its document, and this refuses to proceed unless the
// document in front of us is the one named. Refusing is the whole feature: the
// alternative is not an error, it is a correct edit to the wrong building.
//
// It also carries the confirmation store, so a destructive command's dry run can
// issue a token bound to THIS document and THIS plan, and the execution can only
// spend it while both still match. See Confirmation.cs.
