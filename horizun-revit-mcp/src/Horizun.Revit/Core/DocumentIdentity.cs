// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHICH document is this, and is it the one we mean.
//
// Reference equality does not answer that question. Revit's Application.Documents
// hands out managed wrappers, and enumerating the set does not guarantee the same
// instance you got from ActiveUIDocument.Document. horizun_health compared them
// with ReferenceEquals and therefore reported, on a real model, an active document
// by name while marking all three open documents is_active=false. The reply
// contradicted itself in the same payload.
//
// Identity here is built from what actually distinguishes a document: its path
// (normalized), its title, and whether it is workshared. Titles are NOT unique -
// two files in different folders share one routinely, and a workshared local and
// its central can too - so the matcher has three outcomes, not two:
//
//     matched  -> exactly one candidate is this document
//     none     -> no candidate is
//     ambiguous-> more than one candidate fits, and we CANNOT tell which
//
// Ambiguous is reported as unknown (null), never resolved by picking the first.
// A mutation that guesses which document it is about is the most expensive bug
// this codebase can ship, so the guess is not available.
//
// No `using Autodesk.*`: the rule is provable without Revit, and it has to be.
