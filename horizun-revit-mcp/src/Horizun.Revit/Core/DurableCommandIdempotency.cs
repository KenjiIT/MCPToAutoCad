// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// Durable at-most-once admission for every typed mutation.
//
// A post-commit reply can be lost. Re-reading after Commit proves the answer was
// true when it was made, but does not help a caller that never received it: a
// normal retry would execute the mutation again. This append-only ledger closes
// that gap. A key is claimed before command code runs and the complete result is
// appended afterwards. On restart:
//
//   completed claim -> replay the recorded answer; execute nothing
//   claim only      -> outcome unknown; REFUSE to guess or run again
//   different hash -> conflict; execute nothing
//
// A torn final append is deliberately equivalent to claim-only. Losing certainty
// must fail closed, not turn into permission to repeat a write.
