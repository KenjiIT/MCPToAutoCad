// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_export decides which files on disk it may report as PRODUCED by
// comparing a snapshot taken before Revit's exporter ran against one taken
// after. This is the Revit-free half of that decision, so it is testable
// without a Revit in the room.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX, found in review: the old snapshot dropped a
// path from its dictionary entirely when FileInfo threw (locked, a permission
// blip) - so a file that already existed but was merely unreadable AT THAT
// INSTANT came back MISSING from the 'before' map, and the diff then read that
// absence as "this file did not exist before" and reported it as newly
// PRODUCED. A pre-existing file that Revit never touched could pass as new
// evidence of the export.
//
// The fix separates two different facts a snapshot can know about a path:
//   EXISTED   - Directory.GetFiles returned it, whether or not it could be read.
//   READABLE  - size, mtime AND a content hash were all measured.
// A path that existed but was not readable BEFORE the call is reported
// UNMEASURED, never PRODUCED - "we could not look" must never add up to "it
// is new", the same rule PostconditionCheck.Unreadable enforces for a single
// property.
