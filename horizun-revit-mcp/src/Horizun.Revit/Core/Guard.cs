// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// THE "CANNOT LIE" CONTRACT.
//
// Every Horizun write is built on one rule: never report an outcome you did not
// verify. Three real defects, measured on one model in one afternoon, are why:
//
//   1. A batch purge reported "758 types purged". Nothing was purged. Revit had
//      rolled the whole transaction back and Transaction.Commit() returned
//      RolledBack WITHOUT throwing. The script counted its own Delete() calls.
//   2. Keynote tags placed on 12 elements, reported "12 tagged". Every tag
//      rendered empty. The count was of tags created, not of tags with text.
//   3. A beam's Volume parameter said 0.4531 m3 while its geometry said 0.7913 —
//      a 75% gap on the number you bill. No handler said a word.
//
// The pattern: the code measured its own intent, not the model's state. So commit
// through Guard.Commit (a silent rollback becomes an error), count what the model
// says AFTER the write, and when two sources of one quantity disagree return BOTH.
//
// The Revit-FREE arithmetic lives in Reconcile.cs so it can be unit-tested without
// loading Autodesk assemblies; Guard delegates to it and re-exposes it so handlers
// call one facade (Guard.ToM, Guard.Verify, Guard.Reconcile).
