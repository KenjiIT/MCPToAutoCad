// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHERE HORIZUN KEEPS ITS STATE. One answer, for both halves.
//
// This file exists because there were SEVEN answers. Settings, discovery, jobs
// and the two logs each computed their own path from
// Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData, in two projects that ship
// separately - and every one of them was a different line of code that happened
// to agree.
//
// They only happen to agree while LocalApplicationData means the same thing in
// every process. It does not have to:
//
//   - A PACKAGED HOST REDIRECTS IT. Under MSIX/AppContainer, FOLDERID_LocalAppData
//     resolves into the package's own LocalCache, per package. The MCP server is
//     launched by the MCP client and Revit is launched by the user, so if the
//     client is packaged the two get different roots and neither is told.
//   - A different user or elevation context is a different profile outright.
//   - Folder-redirection policy moves it for some processes and not others.
//
// MEASURED, because the first version of this header got it wrong and the test
// written from that mistake could not have failed: on .NET 8,
// Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData) does NOT read
// %LOCALAPPDATA%. Setting that variable in-process changes the variable and
// leaves GetFolderPath returning C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local. The same is true
// of SpecialFolder.UserProfile. Both go to the Win32 known-folder API. So a test
// that moves the environment variable proves nothing about the old code, and the
// property is pinned by HorizunPathsSourceTests instead - which reads the shipped
// sources and fails if any state path is computed from LocalApplicationData again.
//
// The failure mode is not an error. The server writes a job record Revit never
// sees, or reads a discovery directory the add-in never wrote to, and every
// symptom points somewhere else: "no Revit has published a bridge" while Revit
// sits there with the add-in loaded and its own log growing.
//
// So the root is the user's HOME, which is the one location every process owned
// by a user agrees on and which nothing virtualises per-package:
//
//     %USERPROFILE%\.horizun\
//         settings.json
//         discovery\revit-<year>-<pid>.json
//         jobs\<id>.jsonl
//         logs\revit-<year>.log, server.log
//
// NOTHING HERE IS CACHED. The environment is read on every call, exactly as
// Settings.cs re-reads its file on every use, so a test can move the root and a
// running process can be asked what it resolves to right now rather than what it
// resolved to at startup. These are string operations on two environment
// variables; the cost of being able to answer honestly is smaller than the cost
// of a stale answer.
//
// Linked into the server rather than duplicated - the same reason Settings.cs is.
// It carries no `using Autodesk.*`, so nothing Revit comes with it.
