// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// "I never got your answer. Here it is again."
//
// AT-MOST-ONCE ONLY HELD IF THE REQUEST ARRIVED ONCE. AsyncQueue guarantees a
// queued entry is claimed exactly once, and that guarantee was described as the
// reason run_async is safe to point at a mutation. It is half the story. The
// other half is the wire:
//
//   caller -> server -> pipe -> add-in       the script is queued
//   caller <- server <- pipe <- add-in       THE REPLY IS LOST
//
// The work is queued and will run. The caller has no job_id, no evidence
// anything happened, and a timeout. What it does next is send the request again -
// which is the correct thing for a client to do and produces a SECOND queue
// entry, claimed exactly once, executed exactly once, for a total of twice.
// Nothing downstream can tell those two apart from two deliberate runs.
//
// So a run_async request must carry an idempotency_key, and a key is bound to
// the WHOLE claim:
//
//   * the Revit process id      - a key means nothing across a restart
//   * the document identity     - the same script against another model is
//                                 another operation, not a retry
//   * SHA-256 of the code       - the script IS the payload
//   * every other argument      - canonicalised, so key order in the JSON does
//                                 not change the answer and a changed value does
//
// Re-sending the same key with the same claim returns the ORIGINAL job_id and
// queues nothing. Re-sending it with a different claim is REFUSED: a key that
// silently covered a different payload would be worse than no key at all, since
// the caller would believe the second request had been deduplicated when in fact
// it was discarded.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT SURVIVE, stated because the guarantee is otherwise easy to
// over-read: the ledger is in memory, in this Revit process, exactly like
// ConfirmationStore and for the same reason. If Revit restarts, every key it
// issued is forgotten, and a retry after a restart WILL run the script again.
// That is not a hole that can be closed by persisting it - a key whose job was
// in flight when the process died has an outcome nobody knows, and replaying a
// mutation on that basis is the failure this file exists to prevent, not the
// cure for it. The process id is in the fingerprint so the binding is explicit
// and the reply can say which process the promise belongs to.
//
// Revit-free: the rule has to be provable without a building.
