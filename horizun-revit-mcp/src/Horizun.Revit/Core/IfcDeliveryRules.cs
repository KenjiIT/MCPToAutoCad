// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// VERIFIED IFC DELIVERY - the Revit-free half of horizun_deliver_ifc.
//
// A delivery is a FILE somebody else will open. Its verdict is therefore the
// file's, not the model's: the IDS is evaluated against the exported IFC, the
// user-defined property sets are looked for in the exported IFC, and the header
// the exporter wrote is read back before anyone is told which schema they got.
// This file holds every decision that can be made without a building open:
//
//   * WHICH FILE_SCHEMA a requested IFC version must produce, and whether the
//     head and tail of the produced file say that (a truncated file has no
//     END-ISO-10303-21 trailer, and a truncated file is not a deliverable);
//   * the closed vocabulary of the coordinate basis the exporter is asked for;
//   * the GATES and the one rule that turns them into deliverable_ready;
//   * the minimal composition of a file name from an information container.
//
// NAMING IS DELIBERATELY MINIMAL HERE. ISO 19650 information containers are
// modelled server-side as well; this is only the pure join the add-in needs to
// name a file, it accepts the same object shape (fields, field_order,
// separator, field_patterns) and adds nothing of its own. An integrator unifying
// the two must keep exactly this behaviour or replace the call site.
