// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// What Revit tried to say while a command was running, and what we answered.
//
// This is the number one way Revit automation dies: a transaction commits, Revit
// raises a warning, a modal dialog opens, and the UI thread stops. The bridge is
// not crashed and not finished — it is waiting for a click that no one is there
// to give, until the call times out with nothing to show for the work already
// done. Anything long enough to be worth automating will hit one eventually.
//
// The obvious fix — swallow the dialogs — is the wrong one, and it is the exact
// lie this codebase exists to refuse. A warning Revit raised is information about
// the model: "these elements have duplicate marks", "this room is not enclosed".
// Making it disappear so the script keeps running turns a bridge that hangs into
// a bridge that lies, which is worse, because the second one gets believed.
//
// So: every failure and every dialog is RECORDED, dismissed only as far as it
// takes to keep going, and reported back beside the command's own result. The
// caller ends up with the answer AND the list of what Revit objected to.
//
// Errors are treated differently from warnings on purpose. A warning is Revit
// telling you something; an error is Revit refusing. Auto-resolving an error
// changes the model in a way nobody asked for — deleting the offending element,
// usually — so errors are left to fail the transaction, and reported.
