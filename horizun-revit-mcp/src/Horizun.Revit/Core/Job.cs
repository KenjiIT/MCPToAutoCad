// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// A record of a long piece of work, written as it happens.
//
// Two problems, one file.
//
// FIRST: while a long command runs, the Revit UI thread is inside it and the pipe
// is waiting. Ask "how is it going?" and nothing can answer, because the only
// channel is the one that is busy. So progress does not go through the channel —
// it goes to a file, and the MCP server reads that file without touching Revit at
// all. You can watch a thirty minute job from outside the thing that is stuck.
//
// SECOND: if Revit dies at minute twenty, everything the run knew dies with it,
// and the only honest thing anyone can say afterwards is "no idea how far it
// got". Which is exactly the answer nobody can act on. The file is append-only
// and flushed line by line, so a crash leaves every checkpoint that had already
// happened. The next run reads it and skips what is already done.
//
// Async results can contain model names, paths, element ids and parameter values.
// They are therefore governed by the explicit job retention policy rather than
// described as content-free logs.
