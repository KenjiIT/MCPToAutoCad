// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHICH FLOOR AN ELEMENT STANDS ON, read from where its category actually keeps it.
//
// Revit has no single answer. Element.LevelId is its consolidated one and is right
// for walls, floors, rooms, doors and most hosted instances - and INVALID for a
// beam, whose level is its Reference Level (INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM), and
// for some roofs and stairs, which keep it in their own base-level parameter.
//
// MEASURED (dry run 2026-09, Autodesk sample models): horizun_query_model grouped
// all 397 Structural Framing, 91 Rooms, 6 Roofs and 5 Stairs under "(no level)".
// The read was a `??` chain of parameters, and `??` stops at the first parameter
// that EXISTS - not the first that names a level. A beam carries a level parameter
// holding an invalid id, so the chain stopped there and never reached the one that
// held the answer. "(no level)" over 397 beams that each have one is a falsehood
// with the shape of a fact.
//
// So the rule is an ORDERED list of sources, and a source counts only when it
// resolves to a real level. A source that is absent, holds no id or names
// something that is not a level is passed over. "(no level)" is kept for elements
// where EVERY source was asked and none answered - and the source that did answer
// is reported, so a count per source shows how each level was found.
//
// Revit-free: the Revit half (Commands/ElementLevelReader.cs) only reads each
// source; the order and the stopping rule live here and are proved with fakes.
