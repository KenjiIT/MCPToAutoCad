// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code. Revit-free rules behind three
// horizun_manage_links operations: which importer a path goes to (add kind), when
// acquire_coordinates must refuse before Revit is asked, and how scan_deviation
// judges one face from its sampled point distances.
//
// WHY THE FACE RULE IS STRICT. A scan does not see every face: the top of a wall
// under a slab, the side of a column against a wall. A face that gathered too few
// points, or points covering too little of it, was not measured, and reporting it "ok"
// would turn a hole in the scan into a pass. So the face is not_measured, the
// element that has one (sampled or not: non-planar faces and faces beyond the
// per-element limit count too) is at best partially_measured, and only elements
// whose every face was measured and within tolerance are "ok".
