// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// Whether Revit's UI thread is stuck on a modal dialog RIGHT NOW - asked from a
// thread that is not stuck (story 5.19).
//
// Interference sees dialogs raised WHILE a command runs on the UI thread. A
// modal that is already up BEFORE the call - the measured case was a "New
// Project" dialog - means the command never reaches the UI thread, so the one
// dialog that costs a caller its whole 600 s timeout is exactly the one the
// dialog watcher cannot see. The transport thread is not blocked, and Win32
// answers it: when a modal dialog is up, Revit's MAIN window is disabled and
// the dialog is the visible, enabled window on the same UI thread.
//
// Two facts are captured ONCE, on the UI thread, at startup - the main window
// handle and the UI thread's native id - because they are the two things a
// background thread cannot ask for itself.
//
// The probe never throws and never invents: a probe that could not look
// answers null ("no modal seen"), because failing a caller's request over a
// window this code could not actually observe would be the timeout lie again
// with a different alibi.
//
// DescribeModalDetail() (added for horizun_health's blocked-UI-thread report)
// goes one step further than DescribeModal()'s single formatted line: once the
// dialog's own HWND is found, its CHILD windows are enumerated too, so the
// reply can NAME the dialog rather than just prove one is up - its title, a
// best-effort main text (the longest Static/SysLink child, which is a
// heuristic and says so), every Button child's caption in z-order, and the
// module that owns its window class when Win32 can resolve one. Every field
// here is DIRECTLY OBSERVED or explicitly null; nothing is inferred from the
// class name or the title. This code never clicks or posts to the dialog -
// it only reads.
