// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_document_session operation=new_project: a blank project from a template,
// saved to a path that did not exist, decided out of facts before Revit is asked.
//
// Course dry run 2026-09-30, defect #18: "start a new project for the DWG" had no
// typed route - the session offered open, save, save_as, close, inspect and sync -
// so the run fell back to a copy of another model with a new level, which dragged
// 172 unrelated element modifications along. The Revit half is one call
// (Application.NewProjectDocument) and a SaveAs; what has to be right is around it:
//
//   * IT NEVER OVERWRITES. There is no overwrite flag for new_project. A path that
//     holds a file, or whose existence cannot be tested, is refused: "create a new
//     project" that replaced last month's model would be the worst reading of a
//     harmless request.
//   * THE TEMPLATE IS NAMED, NEVER GUESSED. template_path when given; otherwise the
//     Revit installation's own DefaultProjectTemplate (Options > File Locations, set
//     per locale by the installer) and the reply says which. Neither existing is a
//     refusal - not a silent "no template" project, which has no levels, views or
//     families and is not what anybody means by a new project.
//   * REHEARSED FIRST. dry_run defaults to true, as for sync_with_central: the
//     rehearsal reads both paths and issues a token bound to them; the apply spends
//     it, and a template or target that changed in between is refused.
//
// No `using Autodesk.*`: the command gathers the facts, this decides.
