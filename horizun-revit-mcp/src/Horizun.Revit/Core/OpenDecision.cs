// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// Whether a model may be opened, decided out of FACTS rather than out of Revit.
//
// This is the half of OpenGuard that can be proved. Reading a file header needs
// BasicFileInfo and opening a document needs a UIApplication, but the rules - is a
// newer file openable, is an unreadable version a clearance, does detach excuse a
// central - are arithmetic over four strings and four booleans. Kept in a Revit
// file they were only ever exercised by opening real models on a real machine,
// which is why the two commands could carry different versions of them for months
// without anybody noticing: nothing compared the tables, because there was no table
// to compare, only two sequences of if-statements in two large files.
//
// So the facts are gathered by OpenGuard (which needs Revit) and the decision is
// made here (which does not). The whole table is one method, and every branch of it
// is a test.
//
// THE TABLE, stated once so it can be read without following the code:
//
//   expected_version absent, and required        -> refuse
//   expected_version present, != host            -> refuse (the wrong bridge)
//   cloud model                                  -> version unknowable, guard skipped
//   path ALREADY OPEN in this session, no detach
//     and no audit                               -> activation only: no upgrade guard
//   file version unreadable, no allow_upgrade    -> refuse (unknown is not a match)
//   file NEWER than host                         -> refuse ALWAYS (no downgrade exists)
//   file OLDER than host, no allow_upgrade       -> refuse (the irreversible upgrade)
//   central, no detach and no open_central       -> refuse
//   central UNKNOWN, no detach and no open_central -> refuse (unknown is not a no)
//   otherwise                                    -> open it
