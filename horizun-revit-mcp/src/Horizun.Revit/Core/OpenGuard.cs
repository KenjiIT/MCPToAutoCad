// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// ONE set of guards for opening a model, because there were two and they differed.
//
// Two commands open documents: horizun_open_document and horizun_document_session
// with operation=open. They were written months apart, each carefully, and each
// ended up with guards the other did not have. Crossing them is the only way to
// see it, and what crossing them showed:
//
//   THE CENTRAL GUARD EXISTED IN ONE OF THEM. open_document refuses a workshared
//   CENTRAL model unless open_central=true, because opening one directly means
//   working in the file everybody else synchronizes to. document_session had no
//   such check at all - so the tool with "guarded against the irreversible" in its
//   description was the one that would open a central without a word. The safer
//   sounding tool was the less safe one, which is the worst possible arrangement:
//   a caller reaches for it BECAUSE of the promise.
//
//   THE NEWER-FILE RULE EXISTED IN THE OTHER. A file saved in a Revit NEWER than
//   the host cannot be opened at all, and allow_upgrade cannot help - there is no
//   downgrade. document_session says that. open_document treated every mismatch as
//   one kind, so allow_upgrade=true on a newer file produced Revit's own error
//   about a file format instead of the sentence explaining why no flag can fix it.
//
//   CLOUD EXISTED IN ONE OF THEM. open_document opens ACC / BIM 360 models by
//   GUID; document_session could not, so the only route to a cloud model was the
//   command WITHOUT the expected_version check - exactly the models most likely to
//   be opened from a batch across several Revit years.
//
// So neither was the strict one. Each was strict about what its author had been
// bitten by. This file gathers the facts, OpenDecision.cs applies the rules, and
// both commands are callers - which also means the next lesson is learned in one
// place instead of in whichever file somebody happens to be editing.
//
// The split matters: everything here needs Revit (BasicFileInfo, ModelPathUtils,
// UIApplication) and can only be exercised by opening real models. Everything in
// OpenDecision.cs is arithmetic over strings and booleans, and every branch of it
// is a test.
//
// WHAT CHANGED FOR CALLERS, stated rather than buried:
//   * document_session open now refuses a CENTRAL model unless detach=true or
//     open_central=true. Anything that opened centrals through it must now say so.
//   * A CLOUD MODEL IS A CENTRAL MODEL. It is the file the team syncs to, and
//     opening it non-detached is exactly the thing the central guard exists to
//     stop - living in the cloud rather than on a server share does not make it
//     less shared. So the same flag is required for it. This is new for cloud
//     opens, and it is a guard that was missing rather than a rule tightened for
//     its own sake.
//   * open_document now accepts expected_version, and applies the newer-file rule.
//   * document_session now honours open_all_worksets, which it used to accept and
//     silently drop by taking the bare-path overload of OpenAndActivateDocument.
