// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// THE PREVENTION GATE ON THE OPERATIONS THIS BRIDGE OWNS.
//
// horizun_save_document and horizun_export take an optional `require_gate`.
// Without it they behave exactly as before. With it, the operation runs only
// if the model - MEASURED AGAIN, NOW, by the same checks horizun_audit_model
// runs - satisfies the profile the caller declared. One evaluator, not two:
// the rows in a refusal are the rows the audit would have returned for the
// same requirement set, produced by PreDeliveryGateRules, and the decision is
// PreventionGateRules'. This file only decides what to hand them and how to
// say the answer.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS FILE HOLDS:
//
//   * NOT ASSESSABLE IS NOT FAIL, and it leads with the coverage problem. A
//     row that could not be measured, a check that died, a closed workset -
//     each is a reason nobody can say the model is clean, and none is a
//     defect. If the refusal did not say which, people would stop passing
//     require_gate on every workshared model, and the gate would be gone.
//   * AN OVERRIDE NAMES WHAT IT ACCEPTS. It may name a check, a requirement or
//     a finding id, and it covers exactly the failing rows it names. It
//     expires by comparison against a now_utc the caller supplies; no clock is
//     read here.
//   * THE GATE SAYS WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER. Revit's own Save, Save As,
//     Synchronize with Central and Export menu are not intercepted - the events
//     exist and this add-in deliberately subscribes to none of them - and every
//     gated reply says so, whichever way it decided, so a gate on the bridge's
//     save is never read as "this model cannot be delivered dirty".
//
// Revit-free, so all of it is provable at a desk.
