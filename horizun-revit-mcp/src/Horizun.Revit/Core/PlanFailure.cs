// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHAT A FAILED ATOMIC PLAN IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM, as data rather than as a
// sentence a person has to trust.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX, found in review. ExecutePlan's catch called
// group.RollBack() and returned the fixed prose "EVERY action was rolled back" -
// WITHOUT looking at what RollBack() returned. TransactionGroup.RollBack() hands
// back a TransactionStatus; a value other than RolledBack (Pending, Error) means
// the model's state is UNCERTAIN, not clean. The old message asserted the clean
// case unconditionally, which is the same family of lie as counting Delete()
// calls instead of re-reading the model (see Guard). A live probe that only
// compared a count before and after could pass on a refusal that never reached
// the group at all - a stale token, a confirmation miss, a first-action failure -
// none of which prove a rollback.
//
// THE RULE. A rollback may be CLAIMED complete only when the group's FINAL status
// is RolledBack. Everything else keeps its uncertainty and says so. And every
// reached action reports its own index/key/tool/success/error, so a caller reads
// where the graph got to instead of a summary that could be wrong.
//
// Revit-free on purpose: the classification and the wording are the part whose
// honesty has to be provable in CI without loading Autodesk assemblies. The Revit
// side (Guard.RollBack) converts a TransactionStatus to its name and hands it
// here; the same "is this a confirmed rollback?" question is answered in one place
// for both.
