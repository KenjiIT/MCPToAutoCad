// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// THE BOOK A PLAN KEEPS WHILE IT RUNS, and the decision it takes after each
// action: may the next one run, and may this group be assimilated at the end.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE ExecutePlanCommand. That command cannot be constructed
// without a Revit - it needs a UIApplication, a Document and a TransactionGroup -
// so every scenario that matters here was, until now, unreachable by any test:
// a child that answers success over a rollback, a partial write followed by a
// DELETE, a failure in the middle of a graph that already wrote. Those are exactly
// the cases where being wrong is most expensive, and exactly the cases a live
// Revit will not produce on demand.
//
// So the Revit stays in the command (transaction group, rollback, the gate) and
// the DECISION lives here, where each case is an ordinary test. The command holds
// one of these and asks it; it does not re-implement any of it, which is what
// keeps the tested rule and the shipped rule the same rule.
//
// THE RULE, in one line: an action may be built on, and a group may be kept, only
// while every action so far declared a full application (ApplicationOutcome).
// Transport success is not that, command success is not that, and neither is a
// row existing in the trace.
