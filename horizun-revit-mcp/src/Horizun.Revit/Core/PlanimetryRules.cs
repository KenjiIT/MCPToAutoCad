// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - what the planimetry auditor CONCLUDES, with no Revit in it.
//
// Two halves, and the line between them is the whole design:
//
//   UNIVERSAL rules are the ones that are true without a company's standard. A
//   viewport that overlaps another viewport is wrong on any sheet in any office
//   in any country. A tag pointing at nothing is broken. A dimension whose
//   references Revit will not resolve is not measuring anything. Those are
//   findings this bridge is entitled to make on its own.
//
//   Everything with a NUMBER or a NAME in it - the margin, the allowed scales,
//   the sheet-number format, which categories must be tagged - is a standard,
//   and a standard arrives as an argument. AGENTS.md: no company's catalogues
//   are compiled in.
//
// Three rules run through every check below:
//
//   1. AN UNREADABLE FACT IS `unknown`, NEVER A PASS. Every check that depends
//      on something Revit would not answer emits an `unknown` finding for that
//      element instead of quietly leaving it out. A check with unknowns is
//      reported as unknown, not passed.
//   2. NO SCORE. There is no 0-100 anywhere in this file. The findings are the
//      deliverable; a single number invites the reader to stop reading.
//   3. GEOMETRY IS ONLY EVIDENCE WHEN IT WAS MEASURED. "Outside the crop" is a
//      finding only when the crop is active AND its shape was read AND the
//      element's box was read. Otherwise the situation is unknown, and it says
//      so, because a documentation defect asserted from geometry nobody could
//      read is worse than no finding at all.
//
// Pure, so every one of these decisions is an ordinary unit test.
