// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// EVERY PROPERTY THAT WAS ASKED FOR, RE-READ FROM THE COMMITTED MODEL AND COMPARED
// ONE BY ONE - and the rule that only a complete, fully measured checklist may be
// called verified.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX, found in review. create_schedule declared
// verified_applied on a post-condition that compared three of the five things the
// request contained: fields, include_links and itemized. The schedule's NAME and
// its CATEGORY were never re-read - the reply even reported `category` from the
// Category object resolved BEFORE the commit, which is the request talking, not
// the model. A schedule created under a different name, or against a category
// Revit resolved differently, came back as fully verified.
//
// THREE RULES, and each one is a way the old boolean could say true:
//
//   1. AN EMPTY CHECKLIST IS NOT A PASS. `true && true && true` over three checks
//      and `true` over none look identical once they are a bool. A checklist with
//      nothing in it is unverified, always.
//   2. AN UNREADABLE PROPERTY IS NOT A MATCH. If the re-read throws, that property
//      was not measured - which is neither "it is right" nor "it is wrong". It
//      cannot pass, and the reason travels with it.
//   3. THE CHECKLIST IS THE EVIDENCE, not a summary of it. Every comparison is
//      published with what was requested and what the model actually returned, so
//      a caller can see WHICH property failed rather than being told that one did.
//
// Revit-free: the reads need a Document, the rule about what they add up to does
// not, and the cases that matter (a property that could not be read, a checklist
// nobody added to) are exactly the ones a live Revit will not produce on demand.
