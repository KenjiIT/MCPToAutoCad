// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_execute_python read_only=true: the script runs inside a TransactionGroup
// that is ALWAYS rolled back, so an analysis script cannot leave a mark on the
// model. Two things this file exists to be honest about:
//
//   1. A TransactionGroup rollback undoes MODEL writes. It does nothing to a call
//      that writes bytes directly - Document.Save/SaveAs, closing or opening a
//      document - because those happen OUTSIDE any transaction. A script that
//      calls Save() inside a "read-only" run would produce a REAL file on disk
//      that no rollback can take back. So these calls are refused BEFORE the
//      script runs, the same way an unsupported syntax is refused at preflight -
//      not caught afterwards and apologised for.
//
//   2. This is a TEXTUAL SCAN over the masked source (comments/strings blanked,
//      the same technique TypedOverlaps uses in ExecutePythonCommand.cs), not a
//      sandbox. It matches the literal Revit API method names and can be evaded
//      by anyone who tries: getattr(doc, 'Sa' + 've')() sails straight past it.
//      It exists to stop the ORDINARY case - a script that forgot read_only
//      changes nothing about what Save() does - not a hostile one. The honest
//      ceiling is stated on the tool and in the refusal message, not hidden.
//
// Revit-free: pure string matching and pure comparison, both provable in CI
// without a Revit in the room.
