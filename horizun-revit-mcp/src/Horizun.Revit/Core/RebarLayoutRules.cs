// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - what a declared reinforcement LAYOUT actually produces.
// Original Horizun code. No Revit types: this is arithmetic, and arithmetic is
// provable at a desk.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL.
//
// A rebar set is the one thing in this bridge where "it was created" is almost
// worthless as evidence. Revit will happily accept a layout, place the bars, and
// report a healthy element - with half the set standing outside the beam. The
// element exists, its host is right, its type is right, its shape is right, and
// the steel is in the air.
//
// So the plan has to know, BEFORE anything is written, where every bar position
// will land - not the first and the last, EVERY one - and the apply has to
// compare Revit's own answer against that. Which means the arithmetic below is
// load-bearing: if it is wrong, the plan and the verification agree with each
// other and both are wrong, which is the failure mode this whole repository is
// built to avoid.
//
// Everything here is in MILLIMETRES, because that is what a requirement set
// declares and what an engineer reads. The conversion to feet happens once, at
// the Revit boundary, and never in here.
