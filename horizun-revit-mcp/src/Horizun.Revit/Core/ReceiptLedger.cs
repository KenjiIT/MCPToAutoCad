// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — the operation receipt ledger. Original code.
//
// Story 5.2's missing middle: RetentionPolicy existed, Redact existed, and no
// receipt had ever been written for either to act on. This is the writer.
//
// A receipt answers, after the fact, the question the reply answered in the
// moment: WHAT ran, against WHICH document, with WHAT outcome, and how long it
// took. It records what the command's own reply carried and nothing it did not -
// a receipt that "enriches" its record beyond what was verified would be the
// substitution again, one file downstream of where it usually happens.
//
// Shape on disk: one JSONL file per UTC day, receipts-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl, in
// %USERPROFILE%\.horizun\receipts. Append-only; a failed append NEVER fails the
// operation it records - the answer the caller is waiting on outranks the diary -
// but it is COUNTED, and the count is readable, because a ledger that drops
// entries silently reads like a quiet day.
