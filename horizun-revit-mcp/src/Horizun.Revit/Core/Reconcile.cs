// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// The Revit-FREE arithmetic behind the "cannot lie" contract, kept out of Guard
// so it can be unit-tested WITHOUT loading Autodesk assemblies.
//
// Guard.cs imports Autodesk.Revit.DB for Commit/Assimilate, which pins it to the
// Revit runtime. But the honesty of a quantities takeoff is pure arithmetic —
// "do these two measured volumes agree, and by how much" — and that is exactly
// the logic that must never quietly pick one number, so it has no business being
// untestable. It lives here; Guard delegates to it.
//
// No `using Autodesk.*` in this file, ever. That is the whole point.
