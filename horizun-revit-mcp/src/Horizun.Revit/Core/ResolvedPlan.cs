// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - the MATERIALISED PLAN. Original Horizun code.
//
// WHAT THIS FIXES, in the words the old code used about itself:
//
//   "WHAT THIS DOES NOT TELL YOU: this hash is computed from the request, not from
//    the model, so it cannot detect that the model moved underneath you."
//
// That was true and it was the gap. A confirmation token bound the REQUEST - its
// own fields - so a caller approved a QUESTION. Ask "delete everything matching
// this filter", rehearse it against 12 elements, let somebody else save a change,
// and the same question now resolves to 15. The token still matched, because the
// question had not changed. The answer had.
//
// So a dry run now records WHAT IT RESOLVED - the elements themselves and the
// values it read off them - and the apply recomputes that fingerprint and refuses
// with a stale_plan when it differs. The person approves the operation that runs.
//
// WHY A FINGERPRINT AND NOT THE ELEMENTS. A plan over 100k elements cannot be
// held in a token, and a token is not a place to keep a copy of the model. The
// fingerprint is a hash over a canonical, ORDER-INDEPENDENT rendering of each
// element's identity and the facts the plan depends on. Two runs that resolved
// the same elements with the same values hash the same however Revit happened to
// enumerate them; anything else does not.
//
// Everything here is deliberately Revit-free: no `using Autodesk.*`. The facts
// need Revit, the arithmetic does not - the same split as OpenDecision and
// SprinklerTargets - which is why the cases that matter can be proved in unit
// tests rather than hoped for against a model somebody has to build first.
