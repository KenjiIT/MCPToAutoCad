// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHAT A SCAN REQUEST MAY SAY, and what it must be refused for.
//
// ModelScanCommand already refuses an unknown SECTION name, and the comment
// beside that check states the reason exactly:
//
//     "An unknown section name silently doing nothing is how a caller thinks it
//      checked something it never checked."
//
// The same reasoning applies one level up and was not applied there. Measured on
// this tree at v1.1.6:
//
//   * The tool's InputSchema has no `additionalProperties: false` - the only
//     schema in that file without it - and nothing in the server or the
//     dispatcher validates arguments against the schema anyway. A caller that
//     sends `sectons` gets a full, successful, clean-looking scan of everything.
//   * `top` is CLAMPED, not checked: `Math.Max(1, ...)`. `top: 0` and `top: -5`
//     silently become 1, and there is no ceiling at all.
//   * `sections` is read as `request["sections"] as JArray`, so anything that is
//     not an array - a bare string like "health", an object - yields null, and
//     null means every section. The most plausible client mistake asks for one
//     section and runs the most expensive call the tool has.
//   * An empty array means all twelve too.
//
// Every one of those returns a reply that looks clean. That is the failure this
// file exists to make impossible: a request nobody can satisfy is refused by
// name, and the refusal says what was wrong and what the alternatives are.
//
// Revit-free on purpose. Deciding whether a request is answerable is arithmetic
// over a JObject, and it is exactly the decision that must be provable without a
// model in the room.
