// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// What a script's __output__ CLAIMS, classified WITHOUT crediting it.
//
// THE DISTINCTION THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP. A typed command is verified BY THE
// HOST: it re-reads the model after the commit, in code this repository owns, and
// "verified" there is a fact the bridge is willing to stand behind. A Python
// script is arbitrary code. It can print any words it likes into __output__, and
// nothing on this side re-reads the model to check them.
//
// So this classifier NEVER emits "verified". The strongest thing it can say
// about arbitrary code is self_reported_verified: the script followed the
// contract, said it checked, and attached something it called evidence - none of
// which the host confirmed. An earlier version of this file returned "verified"
// for exactly that input, which let a script that assigned
// {"status":"verified","verification":{"checked":true,"evidence":["ok"]}} come
// back looking identical to a typed write that had actually been re-read. That
// was the contract lying in the one place it was written to protect.
//
// The four states:
//
//   self_reported_verified - the script declared verified, said checked=true and
//                            attached non-empty evidence. NOT host-verified.
//   completed_unverified   - it finished without structured evidence to classify.
//   partial                - part of the operation happened, or only part verified.
//   failed                 - the script's own failure report.
//
// The rule that cannot bend: nothing here ever raises a claim. Every path either
// keeps the script's declared status or lowers it.
//
// A REAL "verified" for Python would need a typed evidence contract - ids and
// property names the host could re-read itself - plus a Revit-side verifier. That
// does not exist, and inventing a generic one is not possible: the host cannot
// know what an arbitrary script was trying to achieve.
//
// Revit-free on purpose: this is arithmetic over a JToken, provable in CI.
