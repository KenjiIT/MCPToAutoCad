// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// What a script HANDED BACK, rendered without losing it.
//
// execute_python used to return `output.ToString()`. For a scalar that is fine.
// For the thing scripts actually build - a dict of results - IronPython's
// PythonDictionary does not override ToString(), so the caller received the
// literal string "IronPython.Runtime.PythonDictionary". Measured on a real run:
// the whole payload of a diagnostic replaced by the name of its own type. The
// data was not truncated or malformed, it was silently discarded, and the reply
// still said executed=true.
//
// So the rendering is explicit, and it SAYS which of the three things happened:
// a scalar passed through, a structure was serialized, or serialization failed
// and only a text rendering survived. The third case is a loss, and a caller is
// told rather than left to notice.
//
// Revit-free on purpose: IronPython's collections are ordinary IDictionary and
// IEnumerable implementations, so the rule is provable with plain .NET types.
