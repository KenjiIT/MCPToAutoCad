// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.

// The Python every execute_python script starts with: stdout capture, and the
// three names a script can call without importing anything.
//
// IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE BECAUSE IT IS PYTHON. Concatenated into the command it
// was invisible to every compiler in the build: a missing colon here breaks EVERY
// execute_python call on the machine, and the first person to find out is a user
// inside Revit. Here it is one verbatim string that a real IronPython engine
// parses in the test suite - the same guard recipes already have.
//
// It is deliberately small. Everything it defines is either impossible from
// inside a script (the job record, the watcher, the dialog policy) or is the
// house contract for using them.
