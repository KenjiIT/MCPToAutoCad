// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// The few things that must be switched on deliberately.
//
// Read by BOTH halves: the server decides whether a tool is even advertised, the
// add-in decides whether it will run. Two checks, not one - the server and the
// plugin ship separately, so a stale server must not be able to enable something
// the machine's owner turned off, and a client that calls a tool it never saw in
// tools/list must still be refused at the far end.
//
// Deliberately dull: a JSON file the owner can read and edit in Notepad, at
//
//     %USERPROFILE%\.horizun\settings.json
//
// The location comes from HorizunPaths, which BOTH halves share. It used to be
// computed here from LocalApplicationData and again in six other places; see
// HorizunPaths.cs for why a per-process environment variable is the wrong root
// for state two processes must agree on.
//
// It is re-read on every use rather than cached, so switching something off takes
// effect on the next call instead of the next Revit restart. That matters most
// for the one setting that exists today: arbitrary code execution.
//
// THE DEFAULTS ARE SAFE FOR AN UNATTENDED AGENT. A fresh install permits typed
// writes inside the active document, but it cannot open/close documents, write
// external files or execute arbitrary code: an absent file, or a file without
// these keys, reads as permission_profile=safe_write and
// enable_execute_python=false. Elevation is always an explicit owner decision.
//
// One asymmetry is deliberate: a file that EXISTS but cannot be parsed falls
// CLOSED (read_only, Python off), not open. The owner may have written an
// explicit restriction into that file, and a corrupted byte must never convert
// "I turned this off" into "everything is enabled".
//
// WHAT EACH PROFILE MEANS. The ladder is cumulative, and each rung is decided by
// ToolEffect rather than by a list of tool names - a list is what let an
// externally-effecting tool be admitted by a profile that forbids external
// effects, because the tool was added to the enum and not to the list:
//
//   read_only    reads, and steers the host (which Revit answers, what is
//                selected). It does not change the model, does not open or close
//                a document session, and writes NOTHING outside the model.
//   safe_write   the above, plus typed writes INSIDE the document.
//   full_write   the above, plus document sessions and typed external writes.
//   unsafe_code  the above, plus eligibility for horizun_execute_python. It is
//                never the implicit default.
//
// ToolEffect.HostState is why read_only still admits something that is not a
// pure read: horizun_target chooses WHICH Revit every later call talks to, and a
// read-only machine that cannot choose its Revit cannot read. It used to share a
// classification with the workbook writer, and refusing the whole bucket would
// have broken the profile this fix exists to protect.
//
// ToolEffect.ExternalSideEffectOnRequest is the same shape of correction one
// level finer. horizun_budget_compare CAN create a workbook and CAN push a Power
// BI table, and both really do need full_write - but a call with no `outputs`
// does neither, and hiding the whole tool refused a read_only machine the
// arithmetic because the same surface can also write. Admission is by effect, as
// everything here is; THE DESTINATION is decided per call by
// AllowsExternalSideEffect below, which the handler must consult before it
// touches a destination. Two halves, and the tool is only honest with both.
//
// The matrix is asserted for every profile against every ToolEffect value in
// SettingsEffectMatrixTests, so a new effect nobody classified fails a test
// instead of quietly inheriting whichever branch happens to miss it.
