// Spatial coherence: the judgement an expert applies when looking at what was just
// modelled. A write that re-reads its own postconditions proves the request was
// carried out; it does not prove the result makes sense. Measured in field use: a
// modelling session committed a column and a door in the same place, every
// postcondition true. Nobody asked the model whether the two solids could coexist.
//
// This file is the pure half - no Revit API - so the rules are unit-tested: given
// two elements' categories and how they relate (host, joined, connected, same type,
// how much solid they share), is the intersection an error, a warning, expected, or
// nothing? SpatialCoherence.cs measures those facts in Revit and asks these rules.
//
// Categories are BuiltInCategory NAMES ("OST_Doors"), which is what the add-in
// reads from Category.BuiltInCategory in every supported year.
