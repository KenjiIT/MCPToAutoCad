// Horizun MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// SYNCHRONIZE WITH CENTRAL - the decisions, without Revit.
//
// A sync is the one write this bridge makes that can be neither rehearsed nor
// rolled back: it publishes the local's changes into a file other people work
// from and hands ownership back to the server. So everything that CAN be decided
// before the call is decided here, in code a test can hold:
//
//   * who may ask: the machine owner's grant AND the workshared read-only policy,
//     which wins over the grant - for the typed operation and for a Python script
//     whose source or includes name SynchronizeWithCentral or a Synchronize
//     postable command;
//   * what the document must be: workshared, not a detached copy, and not in a
//     state SynchronizeWithCentral documents as a precondition failure;
//   * what the preview is: an ESTIMATE. Document.HasAllChangesFromCentral() asks
//     the central whether this local is up to date; ownership (GetCheckoutStatus)
//     and the SAMPLED per-element GetModelUpdatesStatus are the local session's
//     CACHED view, which cannot see what others pushed since the last reload;
//   * what "it worked" means for each relinquish choice, measured afterwards by
//     UniqueId - the API documents that an ElementId may change across a sync
//     (Element.UniqueId remarks), so ids are display values only.
