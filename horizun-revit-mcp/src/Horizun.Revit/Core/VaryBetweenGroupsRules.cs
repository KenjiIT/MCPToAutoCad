// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHEN horizun_write_params_verified should call SetAllowVaryBetweenGroups(true)
// before a write, decided out of facts rather than by trying it.
//
// The step exists for one case: a project or shared parameter bound to a category by
// an InstanceBinding, written with a value that differs between members of a model
// group. Without the flag Revit raises the "ungroup" modal mid-batch and the bridge
// hangs. Everywhere else the setter has nothing to do, and Revit says so with an
// ArgumentException ("This parameter does not support the specified value of
// allowVaryBetweenGroups"). The command used to call it for every parameter whose
// VariesAcrossGroups read false and print that exception on the row - so a clean
// write of Project Information (PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_BUILDING_NAME: built-in
// parameters of an element no group can hold) came back with a
// vary_between_groups_error on every row of a write that succeeded (course dry run
// 2026-09-30, defect #15).
//
// So the step runs only when it can apply, and when it does not, nothing is said:
// there was nothing to set. An attempt that does fail is still reported, as before.
// No `using Autodesk.*`: the command reads the facts, this decides.
