// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// WHERE EACH LAYER OF A COMPOUND WALL GOES, decided as arithmetic.
//
// horizun_split_multilayer_walls turns one compound wall into one wall per
// material layer. Doing that needs a live Revit; deciding it does not, and the
// deciding is the half that has to be provably right, because every one of these
// rules guards a specific way of committing a wrong building and calling it
// verified. The implementation this replaces got four of them wrong at once:
//
//   * THE CORE IS NOT "THE FIRST STRUCTURE LAYER". MaterialFunctionAssignment
//     .Structure, the core boundaries from GetFirst/LastCoreLayerIndex, the
//     geometric centre of the core and the centre of the whole wall are four
//     different things. The old code fell back to layer 0 - the outermost
//     finish - whenever no layer was Function=Structure, and hosted the doors
//     there. Here a wall with no valid core is REFUSED by name.
//
//   * THE LOCATION CURVE IS NOT THE CENTRELINE. WallLocationLine has six values.
//     The old arithmetic (start at total/2 and walk inwards) is exactly the
//     WallCenterline case, applied to all six - so a wall drawn on its exterior
//     finish face came out displaced by half its thickness, committed and
//     "verified". The equation below is that special case generalised.
//
//   * A LAYER OF ZERO WIDTH IS NOT ABSENT. Dropping membranes before summing
//     moved every offset after them. Here they keep their index, keep their
//     NUMBER, and are reported as not materialised - a membrane cannot be a
//     wall, and it cannot vanish from the assembly in silence either.
//
//   * A TYPE IS NOT ITS NAME. Reusing the first WallType whose name matched put
//     somebody else's compound structure on real geometry. Identity here is a
//     digest over material identity, width, function and core membership; the
//     name is for people, and it is checked against the digest before reuse.
//
// Revit-free on purpose: no `using Autodesk`. The command reads the facts off
// the live wall and hands this file plain strings, doubles and ints; the tests
// prove the rules without a building. Sign conventions that CANNOT be settled at
// a desk - which way the exterior normal points - are deliberately not decided
// here: the command measures them off the solid and feeds the answer in.
