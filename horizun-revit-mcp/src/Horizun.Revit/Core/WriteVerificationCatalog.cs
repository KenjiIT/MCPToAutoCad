// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// HOW EVERY WRITING TOOL PROVES WHAT IT WROTE - declared in one table.
//
// The contract of this bridge is that no command reports work it did not verify.
// That is a property of each command's own code, and the 2026-09-24 inventory found
// it held unevenly: some commands used PostconditionCheck (an empty checklist never
// passes, an unreadable property is unmeasured, coverage is exact), others built the
// same verdict from ad hoc booleans that could say true over nothing - a colour
// legend with no rows, a recipe whose every element failed, a pin state that could
// not be read reported as "not pinned" to an unpin.
//
// This table is the declaration that closes the door on the NEXT one. Every tool
// whose contract can change something (the model, the document session, a file, a
// remote dataset) has a row naming:
//
//   * its MECHANISM - how the reply's verdict is produced;
//   * its EVIDENCE - the reply field that carries that verdict;
//   * its SOURCES - where the mechanism lives, so a test can check the claim;
//   * its KNOWN GAPS - what the inventory found and this change did not fix, by
//     file and line, so a reviewer reads the residual risk instead of assuming none.
//
// WriteVerificationCatalogTests (Core.Tests) fails when a writing tool has no row,
// when a row names a tool that no longer writes, when a PostconditionChecklist row's
// sources never construct a PostconditionCheck, and when a command file that opens a
// mutation gate (DocumentGate.ForMutation) belongs to a tool the contract classifies
// as read-only. A new writer therefore cannot ship without saying how it verifies.
//
// Revit-free and data only: nothing at runtime reads it yet. It is compiled into the
// add-in so that the declaration ships beside the code it describes.
