;;; Horizun DWG extractor - runs inside accoreconsole, the headless AutoCAD that
;;; ships with the AutoCAD the user already has installed.
;;;
;;; WHY THIS EXISTS. Revit's imported geometry carries no string, no block name,
;;; no entity handle and no external reference: the bridge measured that and says
;;; so. Everything a conversion needs to be traceable - what a symbol IS, what a
;;; unit is CALLED, which drawing a line came from - lives in exactly those
;;; fields. This reads them from the file itself.
;;;
;;; IT NEVER WRITES. It opens nothing for output but its own report, issues no
;;; command that modifies the database, and the caller runs it against a COPY.
;;;
;;; THE OUTPUT IS LINE-ORIENTED AND TAB-SEPARATED, not JSON: AutoLISP has no
;;; escaping worth trusting for JSON, and a drawing's text is full of quotes and
;;; backslashes. Every field that could carry a tab or a newline is escaped here
;;; and unescaped on the other side.
;;;
;;;   H  <key> <value>                     header variable
;;;   L  <name> <color> <linetype> <flags> layer
;;;   K  <name> <flags> <xrefpath>         block table record (K for blocK)
;;;   Y  <name> <blockrecord>              layout
;;;   E  <owner> <handle> <type> <layer> <data...>   entity
;;;   A  <ownerhandle> <tag> <value>       attribute of the INSERT above it
;;;   an INSERT row ends: <reference name> <effective name> <how: repdata|reptag|definition|empty> <props>
;;;
;;; The walk is entnext over every block table record, which is the only walk
;;; that sees ALL of it: model space, every paper space, every block definition,
;;; and the attributes and vertices that hang off an entity as subentities.
