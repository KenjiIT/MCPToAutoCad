// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP - original Horizun code.
//
// THE WIRE SHAPE of a command's answer, in one place both halves can point at.
//
// It lived inside PipeServer as a private helper, which made every claim about
// what reaches the client an assertion about SOURCE TEXT rather than about a
// value - and the things that ride beside the payload (what Revit raised, the
// fallback signal, the per-action capability gaps) are exactly the ones a caller
// never sees until they are missing. A structured signal dropped in
// serialization is indistinguishable from one that was never granted, and the
// safe-looking failure is the wrong one: the client silently stops falling back.
//
// So the envelope is a pure function of a CommandResult, and the tests build one
// and read the JSON that would go down the pipe.
