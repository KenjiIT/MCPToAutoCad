// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Revit MCP — original Horizun code.
//
// Named-pipe transport. Listens on Horizun-<pid>, reads one JSON request per
// connection, runs it through the dispatcher (which crosses to the UI thread),
// and writes one JSON reply. Line-delimited UTF-8, no BOM.
//
// Request : { "id": "...", "command": "...", "params": {...}, "token": "..." }
// Reply   : { "id": "...", "success": true|false, "data": ..., "error": null|"...",
//             "revit_said": {...}|absent }
//
// revit_said carries the warnings, errors and modal dialogs Revit raised while the
// command ran. It is a sibling of data, not part of it, so no command has to
// remember to include it and a FAILED command still reports what Revit objected to.
//
// One connection = one request/reply. Connections are accepted CONCURRENTLY -
// each is served on its own thread and the listener goes straight back to
// waiting - because the alternative is that a caller cannot even ask whether
// Revit is alive while a long command has the UI thread. It could not: a
// serving loop that handled the request inline left every later client stuck in
// its connect timeout, with nothing to read but "the pipe did not answer".
//
// Accepting a connection is not permission to run in parallel: the dispatcher
// executes one command at a time and holds later connections in a bounded FIFO
// queue. Four slots beyond the maximum executing+waiting command count provide
// headroom for cancellation control traffic under ordinary queue saturation.
