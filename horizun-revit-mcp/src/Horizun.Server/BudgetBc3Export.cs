// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_budget_compare operation=export_bc3 - HOST-RESIDENT, no Revit API.
// Writes a FIEBDC-3 (.bc3) budget from a horizun_quantities TAKEOFF and the
// caller's own APU table (unit prices per code). The per-code quantity is
// chosen by the SAME rules the comparison uses (Core/BudgetComparisonRules:
// by unit, an explicit quantity_field, declared conversions only, partial
// coverage refused unless opted into), so an exported line and a compared line
// can never disagree about what the model measured.
//
// ALL OR NOTHING. A code the takeoff carries and the APU does not price is
// refused - a price is never invented - and so is a code whose quantity could
// not be established; the refusal names every such code and nothing is written.
// A .bc3 missing lines is a smaller budget wearing the project's name.
//
// VERIFIED FROM DISK: the bytes are written to a temporary file beside the
// target, READ BACK, decoded as windows-1252 and held to the budget by
// Core/Bc3Rules.Verify (~V, ~C, ~D, ~M, totals); only then is the file moved
// into place (never over an existing one) and its SHA-256 re-read against the
// verified bytes.
//
// ONCE PER KEY. The call requires an idempotency_key and claims it in the
// durable ledger before the file is touched: a retry after a lost reply gets the
// recorded reply back - after the file it names is re-hashed on disk - and
// writes nothing; a refusal once claimed is the recorded answer for that key.
