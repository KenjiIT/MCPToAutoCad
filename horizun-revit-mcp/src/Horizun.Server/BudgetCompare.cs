// Horizun MCP server - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_budget_compare - a HOST-RESIDENT tool. It never touches Revit: the
// takeoff already happened (horizun_quantities, mode 'takeoff'), the budget is
// a workbook on disk, and the join between them is arithmetic that lives in
// Core/BudgetComparisonRules.cs so it can be proved without a building.
//
// What this file adds to the rules is the plumbing, and the plumbing has one
// principle: EACH DESTINATION IS ITS OWN STORY. The comparison is computed once
// and always returned. Then, for every destination the caller declared, the
// tool writes and reports SEPARATELY - written | replayed | skipped | failed |
// in_doubt, with the evidence that status rests on. There is no global
// transaction to claim, because none exists: a workbook on disk and a Power BI
// table are two systems with no shared commit, and a reply that pretended
// otherwise would be the kind of assurance this bridge refuses to give. A
// failed Excel write does not undo a Power BI push; the reply says which is
// which.
//
// Nothing is written twice. The whole call claims a durable idempotency key,
// and each destination goes through the writer that already owns its ledger -
// ExcelWriteRows for the workbook (lock, backup, re-read verification),
// PowerBiPush for the table (dry_run by default, no automatic retry: a lost
// HTTP answer is in_doubt and stays that way until a person decides - that is
// PowerBiPush's design decision, not restated here).
