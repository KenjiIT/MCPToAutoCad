// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - original Horizun code.
//
// Requests FROM the server TO the client, and the one use they have today:
// elicitation (elicitation/create, MCP 2025-06-18 and 2025-11-25).
//
// Until this file the stdio channel ran one way: the client asked, the server
// answered. Elicitation turns that around in the middle of a tools/call - the tool
// asks the client to ask its user, and waits. Four things have to hold for that
// not to break the rest of the server:
//
//   1. THE READER NEVER WAITS FOR IT. The client's answer arrives on stdin, which
//      only the reader thread reads. A tool that blocked the reader while waiting
//      would wait for a line nobody can read. So the waiting happens on the tool's
//      own thread (tools/call is already dispatched off the reader), and the reader
//      does exactly one thing with a response: hand it to the pending request that
//      owns its id. That is TryDeliver, and it never blocks.
//
//   2. OUR IDS ARE NOT THE CLIENT'S. JSON-RPC ids are per sender, but a log, a
//      proxy or a confused client reading "id 3" cannot tell whose 3 it is. The
//      server's ids are strings with a fixed prefix the client never sends, and a
//      response is recognised by its SHAPE (no method; result or error) before the
//      session's request-id rule is applied - a response reuses our id, and running
//      it through the rule for new requests would refuse it as a duplicate.
//
//   3. EVERY WAIT ENDS. A human may never answer. Each request carries its own
//      timeout; the tool call's cancellation token ends it too; and when stdin
//      closes or stdout is lost every pending request is failed at once, so the
//      shutdown drain is not held hostage by a form nobody will ever submit. When
//      the server gives up on a request it tells the client with
//      notifications/cancelled, as the cancellation utility allows either side to.
//
//   4. ONLY WHEN THE CLIENT SAID SO. A server MUST NOT send elicitation/create to a
//      client that did not declare the capability, or in a mode it did not declare.
//      What the client declared at initialize, and which revision was negotiated,
//      decide it - never a guess. When the answer is no, the tool refuses with the
//      machine-readable code elicitation_unsupported so the agent asks in the chat.
//
// The 2026-07-28 revision does not send elicitation/create as a request at all: it
// returns an InputRequiredResult and the client retries the call with the answers
// (multi round-trip requests, SEP-2322). None of the machinery above is used for
// it. What a modern request may be asked is read from ITS OWN
// _meta clientCapabilities (FromModernRequest), and the answers it brings back
// travel on the ClientContext (InputResponses, RequestState) to the one tool that
// uses them - see ProjectContext's elicit and MrtrRequestState.
