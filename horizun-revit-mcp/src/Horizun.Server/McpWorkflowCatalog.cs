// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - the procedure catalogue. Original Horizun code.
//
// G13 of the 2026-09-14 competitive inventory: "20 workflows prioritarios con
// entrada/salida versionada, ejemplo y prueba".
//
// WHAT THIS WAS, AND WHY IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. The first version listed seventeen
// flows as id, title, minimum permission and a list of tool names. That is a menu.
// It told a reader which tools to reach for and nothing about what the procedure
// TAKES, what it PRODUCES, how it FAILS, or how anybody would know it worked - so
// two people running "deliverable-production" could do two different things and
// both be right, and neither could be checked.
//
// A PROCEDURE IS NOT A SHORTCUT AND IT IS NOT A SECOND EXECUTOR. Every one of
// these is an entry point over the typed tools: it cannot bypass a permission, a
// dry run, a confirmation token or a verification, and nothing here runs anything.
// The catalogue is data. What it adds over the menu is the six things a procedure
// needs to be repeatable by somebody who did not write it:
//
//   inputs      what must be decided BEFORE starting, each one named, because a
//               procedure that discovers halfway through that nobody chose the
//               sheet size has already written something.
//   scope       which elements it touches, and - just as load-bearing - which it
//               does not.
//   output      what exists afterwards that did not before.
//   errors      the failures that are EXPECTED, with what to do about each. A
//               failure nobody wrote down is a failure somebody will read as a
//               bug in the bridge.
//   depends_on  other procedures that must have run first. Stated, not implied
//               by the order of a list.
//   acceptance  how a person decides it worked - measured, not felt.
//
// VERSIONED PER PROCEDURE, not per catalogue. A procedure whose steps change is a
// different procedure, and a run recorded against version 1 must not be read as
// evidence for version 2. The catalogue version changes when the SHAPE changes;
// each procedure carries its own.
//
// ORGANISATION-NEUTRAL, like the rest of the bridge. No company's standards,
// naming conventions or catalogues are in here. Where a procedure needs one it
// says so as an INPUT, which is the same discipline the tools themselves follow.
