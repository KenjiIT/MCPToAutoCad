// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - what a call cost, measured where it happens. Original Horizun code.
//
// The benchmark needs numbers that mean something, and the only place they mean
// something is the path that produced them. A collector that estimates from the
// outside measures its own estimate.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED, and why each one separately:
//
//   QUEUED      how long the request waited before work started. One command runs
//               at a time here, so this is the number that explains a slow call
//               that was not slow - and merging it into the total hides the one
//               thing a user can act on.
//   EXECUTED    the work itself.
//   TOTAL       receipt to answer, which is what the caller actually felt. It is
//               not queued + executed: serialisation and the pipe sit in between,
//               and reporting a sum as a measurement invents the difference.
//   BYTES       in and out. A response nobody can parse because it is 40 MB is a
//               performance result, not a content one.
//   ATTEMPTS    how many times the work was tried, and how many of those were
//               retries. One call is not one attempt on any path with a retry.
//   OUTCOME     ok, error, cancelled or PARTIAL - four, not two. A partial result
//               counted as a success is how a benchmark rewards a tool that did
//               most of the job, and counted as a failure is how it punishes the
//               only tool honest enough to say so.
//
// THE SCENARIO IS DECLARED BY THE CALLER, never inferred. A measurement with no
// scenario is still recorded - it just cannot be compared with anything, and
// saying that is better than filing it under whatever ran last.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS BEEN RUN. The collector is written, wired into the dispatch
// path, and has produced no measurement: this campaign executes nothing.
