// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP - running one of the catalogue's procedures. Original Horizun code.
//
// G13 HAD TWENTY ROUTES AND NO WAY TO FOLLOW ONE. The catalogue said what to call,
// in what order, with what from the previous step - and a caller still had to hold
// all of that in their head, remember which step they were on, and decide for
// themselves whether the result was acceptable. A route nobody can follow is
// documentation.
//
// WHAT THIS IS, and the boundary matters: A RUN RECORD WITH A DISPATCHER, NOT AN
// AUTOMATION PLATFORM. It holds a run's state and it can advance a step - through
// the SAME entry point tools/call uses. There is no second tool registry here, no
// second permission check and no second route to the add-in, which is what keeps
// the guarantees intact:
//
//   - every write keeps its own dry-run, confirmation token and target_document,
//     because the call this dispatches is literally the call a client would make.
//   - a step that needs a human decision STOPS the run and says what it needs.
//     Selecting "all the findings" because nobody was asked is a decision, and it
//     would be made on somebody else's model.
//   - a procedure whose route is prose cannot be dispatched at all: without an
//     argument template there is nothing to send but a guess.
//   - a step already recorded is never dispatched again, so resuming a run cannot
//     repeat a write.
//
// THE STATE THAT MAKES IT RESUMABLE is a file per run, in the same durable
// directory the job records use. A conversation that dies at step 5 of 8 is
// resumed by id, not restarted - which is the whole reason a procedure with eight
// steps needs a record at all.
//
// EVIDENCE PER STEP, AND A VERDICT THAT CAN SAY "I DO NOT KNOW". A step records
// what came back and whether it satisfied what the catalogue said to read back. A
// step whose evidence cannot be judged from here is `not_evaluated` with the
// reason - never `ok`, because a run of eight steps where three were assumed is a
// run nobody can rely on.
//
// NOT RUN. Written during an implementation-only phase; no procedure has been
// started, advanced or completed.
