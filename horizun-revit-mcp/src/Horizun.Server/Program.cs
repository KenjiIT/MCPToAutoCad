// Horizun MCP server — original Horizun code.
//
// A stdio MCP server. It reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC from stdin, answers the
// MCP handshake, and for tools/call forwards the arguments to the Revit add-in
// over its named pipe and returns the reply. The MCP wire format is implemented
// directly from the open spec — no third-party MCP SDK.
//
// Tools are declared in one place (the Tools table). Each maps an MCP tool name
// to the plugin command it forwards to, plus the JSON schema the client sees.
