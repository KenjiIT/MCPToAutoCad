// Horizun MCP server - original Horizun code.
//
// horizun_project_context: the ISO 19650 project context and its intake.
//
// A HOST-RESIDENT tool. It answers in this process and never touches Revit. It
// knows ONE thing that is not caller data: the shape of project-context.json,
// schema_version 1 (schemas/project-context.v1.schema.json, embedded in this
// binary so an installed server does not depend on a source checkout). ISO 19650
// is an international standard, not an organisation's, so modelling its concepts
// here keeps the bridge organisation-neutral: every code, pattern, path and name
// inside a project context is the PROJECT's data.
//
// Five operations:
//
//   schema     the JSON Schema, byte for byte what is embedded.
//   validate   a file against it. THREE different verdicts are kept apart, because
//              they call for three different next steps: INVALID (the file breaks
//              the schema - fix it), INCONSISTENT (valid, but it contradicts itself:
//              a deliverable whose name does not follow the declared naming), and
//              INCOMPLETE (valid and coherent, but ISO 19650 questions are still
//              unanswered - ask them). Nothing is inferred to fill a gap.
//   questions  the ORDERED intake questions for what is still missing, each with
//              the JSON pointer its answer lands on, its type, its options and why
//              it matters, in Spanish and English.
//   ids_from_loin  the structured LOIN block (ISO 7817-1) translated to an IDS 1.0
//              file, proved against ids.xsd and the bridge's own IDS reader; what
//              IDS cannot express is listed, never approximated (LoinIds.cs).
//   draft      answers {pointer: value} applied onto the existing file (or onto an
//              empty context), validated, and returned. dry_run defaults to true.
//              With dry_run=false it writes, then READS THE FILE BACK and compares
//              bytes and content, because a write that was not re-read is a claim.
//              It never replaces an existing file without overwrite=true, and it
//              never writes a context that is invalid or carries a credential.
//   elicit     the same questions asked THROUGH THE CLIENT (MCP elicitation), one
//              short form per thematic block, then applied exactly as draft applies
//              answers. Only when the client declared the capability; otherwise it
//              refuses with code elicitation_unsupported and the agent asks in chat.
//              A declined or cancelled form, a blank field and a question that is
//              not a flat primitive all stay unanswered - and are listed as such.
//              Under 2026-07-28 the forms travel as InputRequiredResult rounds
//              (multi round-trip requests) with a sealed, single-use requestState
//              instead of elicitation/create requests; see ElicitRoundTrip.
//
// Writing is the only thing here that reaches outside this process, and only when a
// call asks for it: the contract classifies the tool ExternalSideEffectOnRequest, so
// every profile admits the reading and the write itself asks
// Settings.AllowsExternalSideEffect before a byte leaves.
//
// The schema validator below is deliberately SMALL: it implements exactly the
// keywords the embedded schema uses, and a test walks the schema and fails if a
// keyword appears that the validator does not know. That is what makes "valid"
// here mean valid, without taking a JSON Schema dependency into the server.
