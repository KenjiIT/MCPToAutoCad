// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - freshness and scope hints for cacheable results.
// Original Horizun code.
//
// 2026-07-28 requires `ttlMs` and `cacheScope` on every complete result of
// server/discover, tools/list, prompts/list, resources/list,
// resources/templates/list and resources/read.
//
// THE SCOPE FIELD IS A PERMISSIONS DECISION, NOT A PERFORMANCE ONE. "public"
// means any shared cache or gateway may serve this answer to anybody. What this
// server publishes is filtered by the machine owner's permission profile, by the
// selected tool packs, and by whether that owner has granted Python - so the tool
// list of THIS machine is a statement about what its owner authorized. Marking it
// public would let a shared intermediary hand one operator's authorization
// posture to another. Everything that varies with local policy is "private".
//
// THE TTL IS SHORT FOR THE SAME REASON. Settings are re-read on every call, on
// purpose: switching a tool off takes effect on the next call, not the next
// restart. A long freshness hint would quietly reintroduce the restart. The
// listChanged notification still fires and invalidates immediately; the TTL only
// bounds how long a client that missed it can be wrong.
