// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - server/discover. Original Horizun code.
//
// 2026-07-28 replaced the initialize handshake with a request a client MAY send
// before anything else, and which a server MUST implement. It answers three
// questions in one round trip: which protocol revisions this server speaks, what
// it can do, and what it is.
//
// It is also the stdio backward-compatibility probe. A dual-era client sends it
// first: a DiscoverResult (or a recognised modern error) means modern; anything
// else means fall back to initialize. That is why the refusal for a request
// missing its protocol field carries the version list in its `data` - see
// RequestEnvelope. A probe that learns nothing has not probed.
//
// WHAT HORIZUN ADDS, AND WHERE. Everything the spec defines lives at the top
// level. Everything of ours - the provenance stamp, the discipline map, the
// measured discovery cost - lives under an `io.horizunhub/` key in `_meta`,
// because the io.modelcontextprotocol/ prefix is reserved and a server that
// invents fields in reserved space is a server clients learn to distrust.
