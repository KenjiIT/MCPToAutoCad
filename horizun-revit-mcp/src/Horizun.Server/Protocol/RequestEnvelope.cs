// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - one reading of a request's protocol metadata.
// Original Horizun code.
//
// 2026-07-28 made MCP stateless: there is no initialize, and every request carries
// its own protocol version and the client's capabilities in `_meta`. This is the
// single place that reads them, decides which ERA the request belongs to, and
// says no - with the right code and the right data - when the metadata is not
// usable.
//
// WHY ONE PLACE. The three failure codes this can produce are the ones a client
// is expected to ACT on: -32022 tells it which versions to retry with, -32021
// tells it which capability to declare, -32602 tells it the request was malformed
// and nothing ran. Spreading those across handlers is how one path ends up
// answering -32601 "method not found" for a request that was merely missing a
// field, and the client concludes the server cannot do the thing at all.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not decide whether a method exists, it does not
// touch Revit, and it never changes the legacy path: a request with no modern
// `_meta` reads exactly as it did before this file existed.
