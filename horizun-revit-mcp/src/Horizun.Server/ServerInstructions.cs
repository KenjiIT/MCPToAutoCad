// The `instructions` string MCP returns from initialize. It lives in its own file
// because it is a CONTRACT SURFACE, not documentation: it is the only channel the
// protocol gives a server for telling a client agent how to behave, every client
// reads it once per session, and it is the only place some of these expectations
// are stated at all. Buried as a literal inside a switch it was untestable, and
// an untested contract surface is one somebody trims to fit.
//
// HEAD AND BODY (2026-09-26). Clients truncate long instructions: Claude Code shows
// 2,048 characters and then "... [truncated]", and the full text was 9,323 UTF-8
// bytes with "health FIRST" about 5.7 KB in (MEASURED 2026-09-26). initialize and
// server/discover now send only Head - the load-bearing rules, bounded to 2,048
// UTF-8 bytes by a test - and Head's first line names horizun://guidance/typed-first,
// which serves Text = Head + Body with every word that used to be sent.
