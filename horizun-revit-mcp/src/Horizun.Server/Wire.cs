// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun MCP server - original Horizun code.
//
// One writer, one reply per request, and a register of what is still running.
//
// The server used to read a line, do the whole job, write the answer, and only
// then read the next line. While a Revit command ran - and model_scan on a real
// project takes over two minutes - nothing else could be answered. Not ping, not
// health, not job_status, which exists PRECISELY to be askable while Revit is
// busy and was unreachable exactly when it was needed. Measured: a job_status
// sent immediately after a three second script answered after the script.
//
// Making that concurrent introduces two hazards that this file exists to remove:
//
//   INTERLEAVED JSON. Two tasks writing to stdout at once produce one corrupt
//   line and a client that disconnects. Every write goes through one lock here.
//
//   TWO REPLIES TO ONE REQUEST. A timeout path and a completion path can both
//   answer. JSON-RPC allows exactly one response per id, and a second one is a
//   loose message the client will either mis-attribute or choke on.
//
// The first version enforced the second rule by having the WRITER remember every
// id it had ever answered, forever. That is a stronger rule than JSON-RPC has, and
// the difference is not academic: an id is only reserved WHILE its request is
// outstanding, and a client that numbers its requests 1..n and reconnects, or one
// that simply reuses a small pool of ids, starts again at 1. Measured: the second
// request to arrive with id 7 was executed in full - the model was touched - and
// its reply was then dropped on the floor by the writer, leaving the client
// waiting forever for an answer to work that had already happened. Silence after a
// completed write is the worst failure this codebase can produce.
//
// So exactly-once is now scoped to the REQUEST rather than to the id. Each
// dispatched call gets a ReplySlot, a one-shot latch it owns; whichever path
// reaches it first answers and the others are refused. The writer serialises and
// nothing else, so an id is reusable the moment its request is done - which is
// exactly what the protocol says.
//
// All of it is Revit-free, so all of it is provable without a building.
