// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Core tests - original Horizun code.
//
// EVERY STRUCTURAL REFUSAL IN THE TYPED SURFACE, CLASSIFIED - and a scanner that
// fails when a new one appears unclassified.
//
// The Python fallback is only safe because "this bridge cannot do that" is
// distinguishable from "your arguments are wrong" and from "it broke halfway".
// That distinction lives at each refusal site, and a site added later without a
// decision would silently land in the third category by accident - either
// granting a fallback after a write, or withholding one that should exist.
//
// So the inventory is data, and the scanner is the gate. Three classifications:
//
//   StructuralGranted - a capability gap decided BEFORE any write. Carries
//                       UnsupportedCapability and reaches FallbackDecision.
//   Argument          - a value the caller can correct and retry typed. No
//                       fallback: suggesting Python would send a client to write
//                       a script around their own typo.
//   PostWrite         - reachable once a transaction may be open. No fallback at
//                       any price: a Python "retry" there is a second write.
//
// Adding a refusal without adding a row here fails this test with the choice
// spelled out. That is the intent: the classification is cheap while the code is
// being written and archaeology afterwards.
