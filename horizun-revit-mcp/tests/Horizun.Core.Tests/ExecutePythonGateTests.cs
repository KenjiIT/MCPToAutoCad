// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Core tests - original Horizun code.
//
// THE ONE COMMAND THAT WAS OUTSIDE THE POLICY.
//
// "Every mutation validates the document" was recorded as met, on evidence from
// seven typed commands. execute_python was not one of them - and it is the
// command that can do everything the other seven can, plus everything they
// cannot. It took whatever document happened to be in front. So the sentence was
// true of the commands that were checked and false of the surface as a whole,
// which is the more expensive kind of wrong: it reads as a guarantee.
//
// These read the shipped source, the same technique as ConfirmationRoundTripTests
// and for the same reason: the handler needs a UIApplication, so the only way to
// assert this without a Revit in the room is over the code that deploys. A test
// that cannot fail on the real defect is decoration.
//
// ORDER IS ASSERTED, not just presence. A gate that runs after the script has
// already been queued is not a gate.
