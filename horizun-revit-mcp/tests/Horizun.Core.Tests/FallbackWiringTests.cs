// WHERE THE FALLBACK SIGNAL IS ALLOWED TO COME FROM, asserted over the shipped
// source. The handlers need a UIApplication and a document, so the wiring cannot
// be exercised in CI - the same technique and the same reason as
// ExecutePythonGateTests. The RULE itself is proved exhaustively and Revit-free
// in FallbackDecisionTests; what is pinned here is that every command reaches it
// and nothing reaches around it.
//
// Three properties:
//
//   1. A command with a real capability edge routes its refusal through
//      FallbackDecision, so the batch rule applies.
//   2. NO command reaches a granting primitive directly (the removed
//      FailUnsupported, or FailWithFallback / FallbackSignal.Allowed / CarryFallback).
//      Each grants without seeing the batch and would reintroduce the mixed-batch
//      defect one command at a time.
//   3. Every grant is positioned before the first transaction in its file.
