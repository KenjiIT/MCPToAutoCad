// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Core tests - original Horizun code.
//
// ONE DATA ROOT, for state that TWO PROCESSES SHARE.
//
// Revit writes a discovery file the server reads, Revit writes a job record the
// server reports on, and both read one settings.json. Each of those locations
// used to be computed separately at each end, from
// Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData - seven lines in two projects
// that ship separately and agreed by coincidence.
//
// The coincidence holds until the two processes resolve that folder differently,
// which is not exotic: a packaged (MSIX/AppContainer) host redirects
// FOLDERID_LocalAppData into its own per-package LocalCache, and a different
// user or elevation context is a different profile outright. The MCP server is
// launched by the MCP client; Revit is launched by the user. When they diverge
// nothing errors - the server lists an empty directory and reports "no Revit has
// published a bridge" while Revit sits there with the add-in loaded.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS CAN AND CANNOT DO, stated because the first version of this
// file got it wrong. That divergence CANNOT be simulated by setting
// %LOCALAPPDATA%: measured on .NET 8, Environment.GetFolderPath ignores the
// environment variable and goes to the Win32 known-folder API. A test that moved
// the variable would have passed against the old code too - the exact shape of
// "a passing test that never ran". So the property is pinned two ways that do
// fail against the previous commit: the root is asserted NOT to be under
// LocalApplicationData, and HorizunPathsSourceTests reads the shipped sources and
// fails if any state path is computed from it again.
//
// They set the environment, so the suite runs serially - see Parallelism.cs.
