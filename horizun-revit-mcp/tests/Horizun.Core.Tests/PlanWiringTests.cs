// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Horizun Core tests - original Horizun code.
//
// Story 5.1 is being wired one command at a time, which means the repository will
// spend a long while in a MIXED state: some commands bind their confirmation token
// to the elements they resolved, the rest bind only the request. A mixed state is
// fine. A mixed state nobody can see is not - and the two ways it goes wrong are
// both silent:
//
//   * A command RECORDS a plan on its rehearsal and then never COMPARES one on its
//     apply. The reply grows a plan_resolved block and a sentence promising the
//     token is bound to those elements, and nothing checks it. That is worse than
//     not wiring the command at all, because the promise is now false in writing.
//   * Somebody deletes the disclosure sentence in DocumentGate while commands are
//     still unwired. Then eleven commands stop admitting the limit, and a caller
//     reads a guarantee that was never there.
//
// These tests read the SOURCE, because that is where the mistake would be made. It
// is a coarse instrument - it matches text, not behaviour - and it is deliberately
// coarse: it has to keep working for the eleven commands that have no test harness
// of their own, since they cannot be instantiated without Revit.
