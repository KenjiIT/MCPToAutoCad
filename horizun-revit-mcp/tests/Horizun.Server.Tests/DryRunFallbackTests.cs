// Horizun Server tests - original Horizun code.
//
// THE FALLBACK HAS TO REACH THE FIRST NORMAL CALL.
//
// dry_run defaults to TRUE on every plan/apply command. So the first thing an LLM
// sends for "create a sprinkler head" is a rehearsal - and the rehearsal used to
// come back success=true, invalid=1, with NO fallback block anywhere. The verdict
// was computed only on the apply path, which a caller reaches by deliberately
// sending dry_run=false. To learn that Python was the way forward, the client had
// to first guess it.
//
// The live probe missed this because it forced dry_run=false: it exercised the
// path where the code already worked and reported the guarantee as proven. A test
// that confirms the implementation instead of the requirement is worse than no
// test, because it is counted.
//
// So these assert the DEFAULT path, end to end, as values: a planning result that
// carries capability gaps must carry the verdict too, through the pipe envelope
// and into structuredContent, on a SUCCESSFUL reply.
