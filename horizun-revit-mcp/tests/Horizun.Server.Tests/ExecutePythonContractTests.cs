// The schema has to ADMIT the arguments the handler demands.
//
// This pairing is where the family_apply defect lived: the command and its
// schema each read plausibly, and only crossing them showed that the three
// fields saying WHAT TO WRITE were absent from the approval. The same crossing
// applies here in the other direction - the handler now requires
// target_document, and refuses run_async without idempotency_key. The schema
// carries "additionalProperties": false, so a key the schema does not declare is
// a key a strict client will not send, and every run_async call would fail on a
// requirement it had no way to satisfy.
